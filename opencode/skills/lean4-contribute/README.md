# Lean 4 Contribute Plugin

> **Contribution helper.** Draft and submit bug reports, feature requests, and
> shareable insights for [lean4-skills](https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-skills)
> as GitHub issues — directly from your editor. Your coding agent may suggest
> drafting at natural stopping points; drafting starts only after you opt in.

**Privacy notice:** Commands may include Lean code snippets, diagnostics, or
diff fragments in the drafted issue body. Every draft is shown in full before
submission, and nothing is sent without your explicit confirmation.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/lean4-contribute:bug-report` | Draft a bug report issue |
| `/lean4-contribute:feature-request` | Draft a feature request issue |
| `/lean4-contribute:share-insight` | Draft a shareable insight from your session |

## How It Works

Each command follows the same four-step flow:

1. **Suggest** — Your coding agent may suggest drafting at a natural stopping
   point. Drafting begins only after you explicitly opt in — or you can start
   directly with a slash command.
2. **Draft** — Gathers context (session state, diffs, diagnostics) and builds a
   structured issue body locally.
3. **Review** — Shows you the exact title, labels, and body that will be
   submitted. You can edit or cancel.
4. **Submit** — After your explicit confirmation, submits via the best available
   channel:
   - **`gh` CLI** — `gh issue create` on `cameronfreer/lean4-skills` (preferred)
   - **Browser** — Prefilled GitHub new-issue URL (fallback if `gh` unavailable)
   - **Email** — Draft email to `lean4skills@gmail.com` (offline fallback)

## Installation

**Claude Code:**
```bash
/plugin install lean4-contribute
```

Other hosts: the commands are plain markdown specs under [`commands/`](commands/)
and may be usable in other hosts that support similar command loading, but
documented setup currently covers Claude Code only.

## What Each Command Shares

- **bug-report** — Summary, expected vs actual behavior, repro steps, a minimal
  Lean snippet, environment info, and build diagnostics. A prose fix summary is
  included when relevant; a minimal patch excerpt is only added after a separate
  confirmation step.
- **feature-request** — Problem description, current workaround, desired
  behavior, acceptance criteria, and alternatives considered.
- **share-insight** — A pattern, antipattern, or mixed insight inferred from
  your session, with a minimal example and context.

All drafts include a privacy/redaction check before submission. By submitting, you agree that the content may be edited, rearranged, or
incorporated into lean4-skills in any form under its
