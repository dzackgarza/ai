# Proof Simplification

Guide for simplifying Lean 4 proofs at the *strategy* level: finding fundamentally
better proof approaches, leveraging mathlib, and extracting reusable helpers.
Complements [proof-refactoring.md](proof-refactoring.md) (structural extraction) and
[proof-golfing.md](proof-golfing.md) (tactic-level optimization).

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Proof seems too long or complex
├─ Is it doing something "basic" in 20+ lines?
│   ├─ Search mathlib — the lemma probably exists (→ Replace with Mathlib)
│   │   └─ Not found → State in mathlib-ready generality (→ Missing Lemmas)
│   └─ Still hard → Definition might be fighting you (→ Definition Problems)
├─ Same pattern appears 2+ times?
│   └─ Extract helper in maximum generality (→ Helper Extraction)
├─ Proof has a complex case split?
│   └─ Search for a congr/EqOn/EventuallyEq approach (→ Congr Lemmas)
├─ Proof manually threads through a definition?
│   └─ Search for a lemma about the definition (→ Replace with Mathlib)
└─ Proof is inherently complex, just long?
    └─ Use [proof-refactoring.md](proof-refactoring.md) instead
```

## Congr Lemmas

Replace case splits where a `congr`-style lemma would be cleaner.

### Pattern: Transfer via `Set.EqOn`

**Before:** Prove continuity by case-splitting on endpoints and interior:
```lean
intro t ht
rcases eq_or_lt_of_le ht.2 with rfl | h_lt
· -- Right endpoint: [10 lines]
· rcases eq_or_lt_of_le ht.1 with rfl | h_gt
  · -- Left endpoint: [8 lines]
  · -- Interior: [5 lines]
```

**After:** Show function equals a known-continuous function on the set, transfer:
```lean
suffices h_eq : Set.EqOn f g s from (hg_cont.congr h_eq)
intro t ht
-- Unified proof (often much shorter)
```

`ContinuousOn.congr` takes `ContinuousOn f s` and `EqOn g f s` to give
`ContinuousOn g s`. Direction matters: `EqOn` goes from the *new* function to the
*known-continuous* function.

### Pattern: Transfer via `EventuallyEq`

When manually differentiating a complex function by unfolding and assembling, show it
agrees with a known-differentiable function eventually instead:
```lean
have h_eq : f =ᶠ[nhdsWithin t s] g := by
  filter_upwards [some_neighborhood_lemma] with x hx
  exact function_agrees_on_interval x hx
exact h_deriv_g.congr_of_eventuallyEq h_eq h_val
```

### When Congr Lemmas Help

- Function is defined piecewise but equals something simpler on each piece

- You need continuity/differentiability/measurability of a complex function

- The complex function agrees with a simple one on the relevant set

- Case splits are about matching definitions, not about mathematical content

## Finset Patterns

Replace Finset induction with direct combinatorial lemmas when the inductive step is
mostly `simp` with `insert`/`erase`/`mem_image`.

**Before:** Manual induction over a Finset with mechanical insert/erase bookkeeping:
```lean
apply Finset.induction_on s
· simp
· intro a s ha ih
  rw [Finset.image_insert, Finset.card_insert_of_not_mem]
  simp only [Finset.mem_image, not_exists] at ha ⊢
  constructor
  · intro h; exact absurd (hinj.eq_iff.mp h) (ha _ rfl)
  · rw [ih]
  -- ... more insert/erase/mem_image reasoning
```

**After:**
```lean
exact Finset.card_image_of_injective s hinj
-- or: Finset.sum_image fun x _ y _ h => hinj h
-- or: Finset.prod_image ...
```

Mathlib has pre-packaged lemmas for `card`, `sum`, `prod`, `sup`, and `inf` over
`Finset.image`. If the induction step is mechanical bookkeeping, the lemma almost
certainly exists.

## Ext Lemmas

Replace manual pointwise unfolding of morphism equality with `ext` lemmas.
Applies when proofs coerce to bare functions and unfold with
`map_add`/`map_mul`/`map_one` chains.

**Before:** Manual pointwise unfolding to show two ring homomorphisms are equal:
```lean
show (f.comp g : R →+* S) = h
apply DFunLike.ext
intro x
simp only [RingHom.comp_apply]
-- unfold (f ∘ g)(x) and h(x), then rewrite with map_* lemmas:
rw [map_add, map_mul, map_one]
-- ... repeat for each generator / case
```

**After:**
```lean
ext x <;> simp
-- or when simp needs guidance:
-- exact RingHom.ext fun x => by simp [h_comm]
```

`MonoidHom.ext`, `RingHom.ext`, `LinearMap.ext`, and `AlgHom.ext` reduce morphism
equality to pointwise equality with the correct coercion context.
Combined with `simp`, this eliminates manual `DFunLike.ext` + `map_*` chains.

## Order/Lattice Patterns

Replace manual monotonicity threading and `sup`/`inf` splitting with compositional
lemmas.

### Pattern: Monotone composition

**Before:** Manual monotonicity through a multi-layer composition:
```lean
intro a b hab
apply hg
apply hf
exact hab
-- or for deeper compositions:
intro a b hab
have h1 := hf hab
have h2 := hg h1
have h3 := hk h2
exact h3
```

**After:**
```lean
exact hg.comp hf
-- deeper: exact (hk.comp hg).comp hf
```

`Monotone.comp`, `StrictMono.comp`, `Antitone.comp` handle arbitrary composition depth.

### Pattern: Lattice sup/inf splitting

**Before:** Manual splitting of a `sup_le` or `le_inf` goal:
```lean
refine sup_le ?_ ?_
· -- show a ≤ c
  calc a ≤ b := h₁
       _ ≤ c := h₂
· -- show a' ≤ c
  calc a' ≤ b' := h₃
        _ ≤ c  := h₄
```

**After:**
```lean
exact sup_le_iff.mpr ⟨h₁.trans h₂, h₃.trans h₄⟩
-- or: exact le_inf h_left h_right
-- these compose: sup_le_sup h₁ h₂
```

`sup_le_iff`, `le_inf_iff`, `sup_le_sup`, and `le_inf` handle lattice plumbing.

## Helper Extraction

Extract repeated proof patterns (same `rw`/`simp` chain 2+ times, same `nlinarith`
structure, same definitional unfolding) as standalone lemmas.

### Extraction Protocol

1. **Find the common core** — what mathematical fact is being proved each time?

2. **State it as a standalone lemma** with the most general hypotheses

3. **Name it after what it proves**, not where it’s used

4. **Place it before first use**

### Generalization Checklist

When extracting, ask:

- **Weaker hypotheses?** Can `=` become `≤`? Can `Fin n` become `ℕ`?

- **Fewer assumptions?** Does the proof actually use all hypotheses?

- **More general types?** Can `ℝ` become `[LinearOrderedField α]`?

- **Mathlib-ready?** Would this be useful in mathlib?
  If so, state it in mathlib conventions (see [mathlib-style.md](mathlib-style.md)).

## Missing Lemmas

Sometimes the right lemma doesn’t exist in mathlib.
Signs: 20+ lines to prove something “obvious”, same proof repeated across projects, only
basic library infrastructure needed, natural place in an existing module.

What to do:

1. State it in maximum generality (most general typeclasses)

2. Follow mathlib naming conventions (see [mathlib-style.md](mathlib-style.md))

3. Use a `private` version locally for now

4. Note it in the refactoring report for potential contribution

## Definition Problems

Sometimes the proof is hard because the definition is fighting you.
Signs: every proof starts with `unfold foo; simp`, same definitional unfolding in every
lemma, arithmetic computations dominate due to discretization.

What to do:

1. **Build the API** — prove key properties as standalone lemmas

2. **Consider alternative definitions** — would an equivalent definition be easier to
   work with?

3. **Use `simp` lemmas** — make key equalities available to `simp` so proofs don’t need
   manual unfolding

## File-Level Audit Checklist

When analyzing a whole file:

1. **Repeated tactic sequences** — same `rw`/`simp` chain 2+ times → extract helper

2. **Proof lengths** — >30 lines for “basic” facts → search mathlib; >60 lines → strong
   candidate

3. **Hand-rolled basics** — continuity proofs not using `fun_prop`, derivatives not
   using `HasDerivAt` chains, arithmetic not using `omega`/`positivity`/`norm_num`

4. **Overly specific hypotheses** — can `=` become `≤`? Can `[NormedSpace ℝ E]` become
   `[Module ℝ E]`?

5. **API coverage** — is every proof unfolding a definition directly?
   Should there be intermediate API lemmas?
