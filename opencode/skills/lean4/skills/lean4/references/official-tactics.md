The tactic language is a special-purpose programming language for
constructing proofs, indicated using the keyword `by`.

## \#adaptation_note

`#adaptation_note /-- comment -/` adds an adaptation note to the current
file. Adaptation notes are comments that are used to indicate that a
piece of code has been changed to accommodate a change in Lean core.
They typically require further action/maintenance to be taken in the
future.

This syntax works as a command, or inline in tactic or term mode.

## \#check

`#check t` elaborates the term `t` and then pretty prints it with its
type as `e : ty`.

If `t` is an identifier, then it pretty prints a type declaration form
for the global constant `t` instead. Use `#check (t)` to pretty print it
as an elaborated expression.

Like the `#check` command, the `#check` tactic allows stuck typeclass
instance problems. These become metavariables in the output.

To display only explicit arguments in the type signature, see `#check'`.

## \#check'

The `#check' t` tactic elaborates the term `t` and then pretty prints it
with its type as `e : ty`. In contrast to `#check t`, we only
pretty-print explicit arguments, and omit implicit or type class
arguments. Currently this only works when `t` is the name of a
declaration.

If `t` is an identifier, then it pretty prints a type declaration form
for the global constant `t` instead. Use `#check' (t)` to pretty print
it as an elaborated expression.

Like other `#check` commands, the `#check'` tactic allows stuck
typeclass instance problems. These become metavariables in the output.

## \#count_heartbeats

`#count_heartbeats tac` counts the heartbeats used by the tactic
sequence `tac` and prints an info line with the number of heartbeats.

- `#count_heartbeats! n in tac`, where `n` is an optional natural number
  literal, runs `tac` `n` times on the same goal while counting the
  heartbeats, and prints an info line with range and standard deviation.
  `n` can be left out, and defaults to 10.

Example:

    example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by
      -- The next line will print an info message of this format; the exact number may vary.
      -- info: 4646
      #count_heartbeats simp

    example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by
      -- The next line will print an info message of this format; the exact numbers may vary.
      -- info: Min: 4 Max: 4 StdDev: 2%
      #count_heartbeats! 37 in simp

## \#defeq_abuse

> **WARNING:** `#defeq_abuse` is an experimental tool intended to assist
> with breaking changes to transparency handling. Its syntax may change
> at any time, and it may not behave as expected. Please report
> unexpected behavior [on
> Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113488-general/topic/backward.2EisDefEq.2ErespectTransparency/with/575685551).

`#defeq_abuse in tac` runs `tac` with
`backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency` both `true` and `false`. If the
tactic succeeds with `false` but fails with `true`, it identifies the
specific `isDefEq` checks that fail with the stricter setting.

The tactic still executes (using the permissive setting if needed), so
proofs remain valid during debugging.

## \#find

`#find t` finds definitions and theorems whose result type matches the
term `t`, and prints them as info lines. Use holes in `t` to indicate
arbitrary subexpressions, for example `#find _ ∧ _` will match any
conjunction. `#find` is also available as a command. `#find` will not
affect the goal by itself and should be removed from the finished proof.

There is also the `find` tactic which looks for lemmas which are
`apply`able against the current goal.

Examples:

``` lean
#find _ + _ = _ + _
#find ?n + _ = _ + ?n
#find (_ : Nat) + _ = _ + _
#find Nat → Nat
```

## \#leansearch

should be a string that ends with a `.` or `?`. This works as a command,
as a term and as a tactic as in the following examples. In tactic mode,
only valid tactics are displayed.

``` lean
#leansearch "If a natural number n is less than m, then the successor of n is less than the successor of m."

example := #leansearch "If a natural number n is less than m, then the successor of n is less than the successor of m."

## Loogle Usage 

Loogle finds definitions and lemmas in various ways:

By constant: 🔍 Real.sin finds all lemmas whose statement somehow
mentions the sine function.

By lemma name substring: 🔍 "differ" finds all lemmas that have "differ"
somewhere in their lemma name.

By subexpression: 🔍 \_ \* (\_ ^ \_) finds all lemmas whose statements
somewhere include a product where the second argument is raised to some
power.

The pattern can also be non-linear, as in 🔍 Real.sqrt ?a \* Real.sqrt
?a

If the pattern has parameters, they are matched in any order. Both of
these will find List.map: 🔍 (?a -\> ?b) -\> List ?a -\> List ?b 🔍 List
?a -\> (?a -\> ?b) -\> List ?b

By main conclusion: 🔍 \|- tsum \_ = \_ \* tsum \_ finds all lemmas
where the conclusion (the subexpression to the right of all → and ∀) has
the given shape.

As before, if the pattern has parameters, they are matched against the
hypotheses of the lemma in any order; for example, 🔍 \|- \_ \< \_ →
tsum \_ \< tsum \_ will find tsum_lt_tsum even though the hypothesis f i
\< g i is not the last.

If you pass more than one such search filter, separated by commas Loogle
will return lemmas which match all of them. The search 🔍 Real.sin,
"two", tsum, \_ \* \_, \_ ^ \_, \|- \_ \< \_ → \_ would find all lemmas
which mention the constants Real.sin and tsum, have "two" as a substring
of the lemma name, include a product and a power somewhere in the type,
and have a hypothesis of the form \_ \< \_ (if there were any such
lemmas). Metavariables (?a) are assigned independently in each filter.

You can modify the Loogle server URL by setting the
`LEANSEARCHCLIENT_LOOGLE_API_URL` environment variable.

following examples. In tactic mode, only valid tactics are displayed.

``` lean

## abel

`abel` solves equations in the language of *additive*, commutative
monoids and groups.

`abel` and its variants work as both tactics and conv tactics.

- `abel1` fails if the target is not an equality that is provable by the
  axioms of commutative monoids/groups.
- `abel_nf` rewrites all group expressions into a normal form.
  - `abel_nf at h` rewrites in a hypothesis.
  - `abel_nf (config := cfg)` allows for additional configuration:
    - `red`: the reducibility setting (overridden by `!`).
    - `zetaDelta`: if true, local `let` variables can be unfolded
      (overridden by `!`).
    - `recursive`: if true, `abel_nf` also recurses into atoms.
- `abel!`, `abel1!`, `abel_nf!` use a more aggressive reducibility
  setting to identify atoms.

Examples:

    example [AddCommMonoid α] (a b : α) : a + (b + a) = a + a + b := by abel
    example [AddCommGroup α] (a : α) : (3 : ℤ) • a = a + (2 : ℤ) • a := by abel

## absurd

Given a proof `h` of `p`, [`absurd`](./Init/Prelude.html#absurd)` h`
changes the goal to `⊢ ¬ p`. If `p` is a negation `¬q` then the goal is
changed to `⊢ q` instead.

## ac_change

`ac_change t` on a goal `⊢ t'` changes the goal to `⊢ t` and adds new
goals for proving the equality `t' = t` using congruence, then tries
proving these goals by associativity and commutativity. The goals are
created like `congr!` would. In other words, `ac_change t` is like
`convert_to t` followed by `ac_refl`.

Like `refine e`, any holes (`?_` or `?x`) in `t` that are not solved by
unification are converted into new goals, using the hole's name, if any,
as the goal case name. Like `congr!`, `convert_to` introduces variables
while applying congruence rules. These can be pattern-matched, like
`rintro` would, using the `with` keyword.

- `ac_change! t` uses default transparency, rather than reducible, when
  solving side goals.
- `ac_change t using n`, where `n` is a positive numeral, controls the
  depth with which congruence is applied. For example, if the main goal
  is
  `⊢ `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` ((a * b + 1) + c)`,
  then
  `ac_change `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` ((1 + a * b) + c) using 2`
  solves the side goals, and
  `ac_change `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` ((1 + a * b) + c) using 3`
  (or more) results in two (impossible) goals `⊢ 1 = a * b` and
  `⊢ a * b = 1`. The default value for `n` is 1.

Example:

``` lean
example (a b c d e f g N : ℕ) : (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f) + g ≤ N := by
  ac_change a + d + e + f + c + g + b ≤ _
  -- ⊢ a + d + e + f + c + g + b ≤ N
```

## ac_nf

`ac_nf` normalizes equalities up to application of an associative and
commutative operator.

- `ac_nf` normalizes all hypotheses and the goal target of the goal.
- `ac_nf at l` normalizes at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or
  a list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a
  turnstile `⊢` or `|-` can also be used, to signify the target of the
  goal.

## aesop

`aesop <clause>*` tries to solve the current goal by applying a set of
rules registered with the `@[aesop]` attribute. See [its
README](https://github.com/JLimperg/aesop#readme) for a tutorial and a
reference.

The variant `aesop?` prints the proof it found as a `Try this`
suggestion.

Clauses can be used to customise the behaviour of an Aesop call.
Available clauses are:

- `(add <phase> <priority> <builder> <rule>)` adds a rule. `<phase>` is
  `unsafe`, `safe` or `norm`. `<priority>` is a percentage for unsafe
  rules and an integer for safe and norm rules. `<rule>` is the name of
  a declaration or local hypothesis. `<builder>` is the rule builder
  used to turn `<rule>` into an Aesop rule. Example:
  `(add unsafe 50% apply Or.inl)`.
- `(erase <rule>)` disables a globally registered Aesop rule. Example:
  `(erase Aesop.BuiltinRules.assumption)`.
- `(rule_sets := [<ruleset>,*])` enables or disables named sets of rules
  for this Aesop call. Example: `(rule_sets := [-builtin, MyRuleSet])`.
- `(config { <opt> := <value> })` adjusts Aesop's search options. See
  [`Aesop.Options`](./Aesop/Options/Public.html#Aesop.Options).
- `(simp_config { <opt> := <value> })` adjusts options for Aesop's
  built-in `simp` rule. The given options are directly passed to `simp`.
  For example, `(simp_config := { zeta := false })` makes Aesop use
  `simp (config := { zeta := false })`.

  rule set in addition to the default rule sets.
- We instruct Aesop's `intro` rule to unfold with `default`
  transparency.

## algebra

`algebra` solves equalities in the language of algebras: ring operations
and scalar multiplications.

Given a goal which is an equality in a commutative `R`-algebra `A`,
`algebra` parses the LHS and RHS of the goal as polynomial expressions
of `A`-atoms with coefficients in some semiring `R`, and closes the goal
if the two expressions are the same. The `R`-coefficients are put into
ring normal form.

By default, the scalar ring `R` is inferred automatically by looking for
scalar multiplications and `algebraMap`s present in the expressions. The
inference procedure assumes that any two rings `R` and `S` that appear
are comparable, in the sense that either `R` is an `S`-algebra or `S` is
an `R`-algebra.

- `algebra with R` uses the term `R` as the scalar ring, instead of
  attempting to infer it automatically.

## algebraize

Tactic that, given

corresponding [`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra)
and (if possible)
[`IsScalarTower`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Defs.html#IsScalarTower)
instances, as well as
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra) corresponding
to [`RingHom`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Hom/Defs.html#RingHom) properties
available as hypotheses.

Example: given `f : A →+* B` and `g : B →+* C`, and `hf : f.FiniteType`,
`algebraize [f, g]` will add the instances
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra)` A B`,
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra)` B C`, and
[`Algebra.FiniteType`](./Mathlib/RingTheory/FiniteType.html#Algebra.FiniteType)` A B`.

See the `algebraize` tag for instructions on what properties can be
added.

The tactic also comes with a configuration option `properties`. If set
to `true` (default), the tactic searches through the local context for
[`RingHom`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Hom/Defs.html#RingHom) properties
that can be converted to
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra) properties. The
macro `algebraize_only` calls `algebraize -properties`, so in other

## any_goals

`any_goals tac` applies the tactic `tac` to every goal, concatenating
the resulting goals for successful tactic applications. If the tactic
fails on all of the goals, the entire `any_goals` tactic fails.

This tactic is like `all_goals try tac` except that it fails if none of
the applications of `tac` succeeds.

## apply

`apply e` tries to match the current goal against the conclusion of
`e`'s type. If it succeeds, then the tactic returns as many subgoals as
the number of premises that have not been fixed by type inference or
type class resolution. Non-dependent premises are added before dependent
ones.

The `apply` tactic uses higher-order pattern matching, type class
resolution, and first-order unification with dependent types.

## apply

`apply t at i` uses forward reasoning with `t` at the hypothesis `i`.
Explicitly, if `t : α₁ → ⋯ → αᵢ → ⋯ → αₙ` and `i` has type `αᵢ`, then
this tactic adds metavariables/goals for any terms of `αⱼ` for
`j = 1, …, i-1`, then replaces the type of `i` with `αᵢ₊₁ → ⋯ → αₙ` by
applying those metavariables and the original `i`.

## apply?

Searches environment for definitions or theorems that can refine the
goal using `apply` with conditions resolved when possible with
`solve_by_elim`.

The optional `using` clause provides identifiers in the local context
that must be used when closing the goal.

Use `+grind` to enable `grind` as a fallback discharger for subgoals.
Use `+try?` to enable [`try?`](./Mathlib/Control/Basic.html#try?) as a
fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `-star` to disable fallback to
star-indexed lemmas. Use `+all` to collect all successful lemmas instead
of stopping at the first.

## apply_assumption

`apply_assumption` looks for an assumption of the form
`... → ∀ _, ... → head` where `head` matches the current goal.

You can specify additional rules to apply using
`apply_assumption [...]`. By default `apply_assumption` will also try
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl), [`trivial`](./Init/Core.html#trivial),
[`congrFun`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrFun), and
[`congrArg`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrArg). If you don't want these, or
don't want to use all hypotheses, use `apply_assumption only [...]`. You
can use `apply_assumption [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis. You can use
`apply_assumption using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been
labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created
using `register_label_attr`).

`apply_assumption` will use consequences of local hypotheses obtained
via [`symm`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#symm).

If `apply_assumption` fails, it will call `exfalso` and try again. Thus
if there is an assumption of the form `P → ¬ Q`, the new tactic state
will have two goals, `P` and `Q`.

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax
`apply_rules (config := {...}) lemmas`. The options supported are the
same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

## apply_fun

Apply a function to an equality or inequality in either a local
hypothesis or the goal.

- If we have `h : a = b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with
  `h : f a = f b`.
- If we have `h : a ≤ b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with
  `h : f a ≤ f b`, and create a subsidiary goal
  [`Monotone`](./Mathlib/Order/Monotone/Defs.html#Monotone)` f`.
  `apply_fun` will automatically attempt to discharge this subsidiary
  goal using `mono`, or an explicit solution can be provided with
  `apply_fun f at h using P`, where
  `P : `[`Monotone`](./Mathlib/Order/Monotone/Defs.html#Monotone)` f`.
- If we have `h : a < b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with
  `h : f a < f b`, and create a subsidiary goal
  [`StrictMono`](./Mathlib/Order/Monotone/Defs.html#StrictMono)` f` and
  behaves as in the previous case.
- If we have `h : a ≠ b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with
  `h : f a ≠ f b`, and create a subsidiary goal `Injective f` and
  behaves as in the previous two cases.
- If the goal is `a ≠ b`, `apply_fun f` will replace this with
  `f a ≠ f b`.
- If the goal is `a = b`, `apply_fun f` will replace this with
  `f a = f b`, and create a subsidiary goal `injective f`. `apply_fun`
  will automatically attempt to discharge this subsidiary goal using
  local hypotheses, or if `f` is actually an
  [`Equiv`](./Mathlib/Logic/Equiv/Defs.html#Equiv), or an explicit
  solution can be provided with `apply_fun f using P`, where
  `P : Injective f`.
- If the goal is `a ≤ b` (or similarly for `a < b`), and `f` is actually
  an [`OrderIso`](./Mathlib/Order/Hom/Basic.html#OrderIso),
  `apply_fun f` will replace the goal with `f a ≤ f b`. If `f` is
  anything else (e.g. just a function, or an
  [`Equiv`](./Mathlib/Logic/Equiv/Defs.html#Equiv)), `apply_fun` will
  fail.

Typical usage is:

``` lean
open Function

example (X Y Z : Type) (f : X → Y) (g : Y → Z) (H : Injective <| g ∘ f) :
    Injective f := by
  intro x x' h
  apply_fun g at h
  exact H h
```

The function `f` is handled similarly to how it would be handled by
`refine` in that `f` can contain placeholders. Named placeholders (like
`?a` or `?_`) will produce new goals.

## apply_rewrite

`apply_rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses the expressions `e₁`, ..., `eₙ` as
generalized rewrite rules, of type `pᵢ → qᵢ`, on the main goal,
replacing occurrences of `pᵢ` with `qᵢ`. The difference with `grewrite`
is that `grewrite` would turn `pᵢ` into a side goal and expect `qᵢ` to
be a relation.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems
associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold
`e`.

- `apply_rewrite [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : p → q` in the
  reverse direction, replacing occurrences of `q` with `p`.
- `apply_rewrite (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as
  configuration. See `GRewrite.Config` for details. To let
  `apply_rewrite` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
  `apply_rewrite (transparency := default) [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
- `apply_rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

## apply_rules

`apply_rules [l₁, l₂, ...]` tries to solve the main goal by iteratively
applying the list of lemmas `[l₁, l₂, ...]` or by applying a local
hypothesis. If `apply` generates new goals, `apply_rules` iteratively
tries to solve those goals. You can use `apply_rules [-h]` to omit a
local hypothesis.

`apply_rules` will also use [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl),
[`trivial`](./Init/Core.html#trivial),
[`congrFun`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrFun) and
[`congrArg`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrArg). These can be disabled, as
can local hypotheses, by using `apply_rules only [...]`.

You can use `apply_rules using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have
been labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created
using `register_label_attr`).

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax
`apply_rules (config := {...})`. The options supported are the same as
for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

`apply_rules` will try calling
[`symm`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#symm) on hypotheses and
`exfalso` on the goal as needed. This can be disabled with
`apply_rules (config := {symm := false, exfalso := false})`.

You can bound the iteration depth using the syntax
`apply_rules (config := {maxDepth := n})`.

Unlike `solve_by_elim`, `apply_rules` does not perform backtracking, and
greedily applies a lemma from the list until it gets stuck.

## apply_rw

`apply_rw [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses the expressions `e₁`, ..., `eₙ` as
generalized rewrite rules, of type `pᵢ → qᵢ`, on the main goal,
replacing occurrences of `pᵢ` with `qᵢ`. The difference with `grw` is
that `grw` would turn `pᵢ` into a side goal and expect `qᵢ` to be a
relation.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems
associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold
`e`.

- `apply_rw [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : p → q` in the reverse
  direction, replacing occurrences of `q` with `p`.
- `apply_rw (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as configuration.
  See `GRewrite.Config` for details. To let `apply_rw` unfold more
  aggressively, as in `erw`, use

- `apply_rw [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

## assumption_mod_cast

`assumption_mod_cast` is a variant of `assumption` that solves the goal

and each hypothesis to move casts as far outwards as possible, so it can
be used in more situations.

Concretely, it runs `norm_cast` on the goal. For each local hypothesis
`h`, it also normalizes `h` with `norm_cast` and tries to use that to
close the goal.

Sets are automatically bounded or cobounded in complete lattices. To use

## bdsimp

[`bdsimp`](./Mathlib/Tactic/BDSimp.html#bdsimp) definitionally
simplifies the goal. This is a backward compatibility macro for `dsimp`.
Like `dsimp`, it applies only theorems that hold by reflexivity, and the
result is guaranteed to be definitionally equal to the input. The
difference is that [`bdsimp`](./Mathlib/Tactic/BDSimp.html#bdsimp)
allows any theorem whose proof is reflexivity, while `dsimp` requires
the proof to hold at `.instances` transparency level.

This tactic is a temporary workaround.
[`bdsimp`](./Mathlib/Tactic/BDSimp.html#bdsimp) also rewrites in
depended-on positions, which means the result can fail to typecheck at
the expected `.instances` transparency level. For example:

``` lean
@[expose] def two := 2
@[defeq] lemma two_eq : two = 2 := by rfl
instance : NeZero two := inferInstanceAs (NeZero 2)

example (x : Fin two) : x * 0 = 0 := by
  bdsimp only [two_eq]
  fail_if_success rw [Fin.mul_zero] -- Fails: `x : Fin two` but `· * · : Fin 2 → Fin 2 → Fin 2`

This tactic supports all options supported by `dsimp`.

`beta_reduce at loc` completely beta reduces the given location. This

expression yielding an expression such as `f y`.

bicategory, where the two sides only differ by replacing strings of

source and target.

That is, `bicategory` can handle goals of the form
`a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'` where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and
`c = c'` can be proved using `bicategory_coherence`.

  former instance by
  [`borel`](./Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Constructions/BorelSpace/Basic.html#borel)` α`;

## bound

`bound` tactic for proving inequalities via straightforward recursion on
expression structure.

An example use case is

    -- Calc example: A weak lower bound for `z ↦ z^2 + c`
    lemma le_sqr_add (c z : ℝ) (cz : ‖c‖ ≤ ‖z‖) (z3 : 3 ≤ ‖z‖) :
        2 * ‖z‖ ≤ ‖z^2 + c‖ := by
      calc ‖z^2 + c‖
        _ ≥ ‖z^2‖ - ‖c‖ := by bound
        _ ≥ ‖z^2‖ - ‖z‖ := by  bound
        _ ≥ (‖z‖ - 1) * ‖z‖ := by
          rw [mul_comm, mul_sub_one, ← pow_two, ← norm_pow]
        _ ≥ 2 * ‖z‖ := by bound

`bound` is built on top of `aesop`, and uses

1.  Apply lemmas registered via the `@[bound]` attribute
2.  Forward lemmas registered via the `@[bound_forward]` attribute
3.  Local hypotheses from the context
4.  Optionally: additional hypotheses provided as `bound [h₀, h₁]` or
    similar. These are added to the context as if by `have := hᵢ`.

The functionality of `bound` overlaps with
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity) and
`gcongr`, but can jump back and forth between `0 ≤ x` and `x ≤ y`-type
inequalities. For example, `bound` proves
`0 ≤ c → b ≤ a → 0 ≤ a * c - b * c` by turning the goal into
`b * c ≤ a * c`, then using
[`mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Order/GroupWithZero/Defs.html#mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right).
`bound` also contains lemmas for goals of the form
`1 ≤ x, 1 < x, x ≤ 1, x < 1`. Conversely, `gcongr` can prove
inequalities for more types of relations, supports all
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity)
functionality, and is likely faster since it is more specialized (not
built atop `aesop`).

## bv_check

This tactic works just like `bv_decide` but skips calling a SAT solver

## bv_decide

Close fixed-width [`BitVec`](./Init/Prelude.html#BitVec) and
[`Bool`](./Init/Prelude.html#Bool) goals by obtaining a proof from an
external SAT solver and verifying it inside Lean. The solvable goals are
currently limited to

- the Lean equivalent of
  [`QF_BV`](https://smt-lib.org/logics-all.shtml#QF_BV)
- automatically splitting up `structure`s that contain information about
  [`BitVec`](./Init/Prelude.html#BitVec) or
  [`Bool`](./Init/Prelude.html#Bool)

``` lean
example : ∀ (a b : BitVec 64), (a &&& b) + (a ^^^ b) = a ||| b := by
  intros
  bv_decide
```

If `bv_decide` encounters an unknown definition it will be treated like
an unconstrained [`BitVec`](./Init/Prelude.html#BitVec) variable.
Sometimes this enables solving goals despite not understanding the
definition because the precise properties of the definition do not
matter in the specific proof.

If `bv_decide` fails to close a goal it provides a counter-example,
containing assignments for all terms that were considered as variables.

In order to avoid calling a SAT solver every time, the proof can be
cached with `bv_decide?`.

If solving your problem relies inherently on using associativity or
commutativity, consider enabling the `bv.ac_nf` option.

Note: `bv_decide` trusts the correctness of the code generator and adds
a axioms asserting its result.

followed by `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not)` at h` in the second
subgoal. For example,

- `by_cases! h : a < b` creates one goal with hypothesis `h : a < b` and
  another with `h : b ≤ a`.
- `by_cases! h : a ≠ b` creates one goal with hypothesis `h : a ≠ b` and
  another with `h : a = b`.

## by_contra

[`by_contra`](./Mathlib/Logic/Basic.html#by_contra)` h` proves `⊢ p` by
contradiction, introducing a hypothesis `h : ¬p` and proving
[`False`](./Init/Prelude.html#False).

- If `p` is a negation `¬q`, `h : q` will be introduced instead of
  `¬¬q`.
- If `p` is decidable, it uses
  [`Decidable.byContradiction`](./Init/Core.html#Decidable.byContradiction)
  instead of
  [`Classical.byContradiction`](./Init/Classical.html#Classical.byContradiction).
- If `h` is omitted, the introduced variable will be called `this`.
- `h` can be any pattern supported by `rcases`/`rintro`.

## by_contra!

If the target of the main goal is a proposition `p`, `by_contra!`
reduces the goal to proving [`False`](./Init/Prelude.html#False) using
the additional hypothesis `this : ¬ p`. `by_contra! h` can be used to
name the hypothesis `h : ¬ p`. The hypothesis `¬ p` will be normalized
using `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not). For instance, `¬ a < b`
will be changed to `b ≤ a`. `by_contra!` can be used with `rcases`
patterns. For instance, `by_contra! `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) on
`⊢ s.`[`Nonempty`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nonempty) will substitute the
equality `s = ∅`, and `by_contra! ⟨hp, hq⟩` on `⊢ ¬ p ∨ ¬ q` will
introduce `hp : p` and `hq : q`. `by_contra! h : q` will normalize
negations in `¬ p`, normalize negations in `q`, and then check that the
two normalized forms are equal. The resulting hypothesis is the
pre-normalized form, `q`. If the name `h` is not explicitly provided,
then `this` will be used as name. This tactic uses classical reasoning.
It is a variant on the tactic
[`by_contra`](./Mathlib/Logic/Basic.html#by_contra). Examples:

``` lean
example : 1 < 2 := by
  by_contra! h
  -- h : 2 ≤ 1 ⊢ False

example : 1 < 2 := by
  by_contra! h : ¬ 1 < 2
  -- h : ¬ 1 < 2 ⊢ False
```

## calc

Step-wise reasoning over transitive relations.

    calc
      a = b := pab
      b = c := pbc
      ...
      y = z := pyz

proves `a = z` from the given step-wise proofs. `=` can be replaced with
any relation implementing the typeclass
[`Trans`](./Init/Prelude.html#Trans). Instead of repeating the right-
hand sides, subsequent left-hand sides can be replaced with `_`.

    calc
      a = b := pab
      _ = c := pbc
      ...
      _ = z := pyz

It is also possible to write the *first* relation as
`<lhs>\n _ = <rhs> := <proof>`. This is useful for aligning relation
symbols, especially on longer identifiers:

    calc abc
      _ = bce := pabce
      _ = cef := pbcef
      ...
      _ = xyz := pwxyz

`calc` works as a term, as a tactic or as a `conv` tactic.

## case

- `case _ : t => tac` finds the first goal that unifies with `t` and
  then solves it using `tac` or else fails. Like `show`, it changes the
  type of the goal to `t`. The `_` can optionally be a case tag, in
  which case it only looks at goals whose tag would be considered by
  `case` (goals with an exact tag match, followed by goals with the tag
  as a suffix, followed by goals with the tag as a prefix).

- `case _ n₁ ... nₘ : t => tac` additionally names the `m` most recent
  hypotheses with inaccessible names to the given names. The names are
  renamed before matching against `t`. The `_` can optionally be a case
  tag.

- `case _ : t := e` is short for `case _ : t => exact e`.

- `case _ : t₁ | _ : t₂ | ... => tac` is equivalent to
  `(case _ : t₁ => tac); (case _ : t₂ => tac); ...` but with all
  matching done on the original list of goals -- each goal is consumed
  as they are matched, so patterns may repeat or overlap.

- `case _ : t` will make the matched goal be the first goal.
  `case _ : t₁ | _ : t₂ | ...` makes the matched goals be the first
  goals in the given order.

- `case _ : t := _` and `case _ : t := ?m` are the same as `case _ : t`
  but in the `?m` case the goal tag is changed to `m`. In particular,
  the goal becomes metavariable `?m`.

`case' _ : t => tac` is similar to the `case _ : t => tac` tactic, but

goal using `sorry` when `tac` fails, and the tactic execution is not
interrupted.

## cases

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor
of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general
instance of that constructor. If the type of an element in the local
context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced
afterward, so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well.
`cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.

For example, given `n : `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) and a goal
with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `cases n` produces one
goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with
hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`. Here the
name `a` is chosen automatically and is not accessible. You can use
`with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.

- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : `[`List`](./Init/Prelude.html#List)` α`,
  `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`, uses tactic `tac₁`
  for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case, and `a` and `as'`
  are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, performs
  cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to
  each goal, where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular
  case.

[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.cases)

## cases'

`cases' x`, where the variable `x` has inductive type `t`, splits the
main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of `t`, in which `x`
is replaced by that constructor applied to newly introduced variables.
This is a backwards-compatible variant of the `cases` tactic in Lean 4
core.

Prefer `cases`, `rcases`, or `obtain` when possible, because these
tactics promote structured proofs.

- `cases' x with n1 n2 ...` names the arguments to the constructors.
  This is the main difference with `cases` in core Lean.
- `cases' e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the
  resulting variable.
- `cases' h : e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then splits by cases on the resulting
  variable, adding to each goal the hypothesis `h : e = _` where `_` is
  the constructor instance.
- `cases' x using r` uses `r` as the case matching rule. Here `r` should
  be a term whose result type is of the form `C t1 t2 ...`, where `C` is
  a bound variable and `t1`, `t2`, ... (if present) are bound variables.

Example:

    example (h : p ∨ q) : q ∨ p := by
      cases' h with hp hq
      · exact Or.inr hp
      · exact Or.inl hq

    -- Though the following equivalent spellings should be preferred
    example (h : p ∨ q) : q ∨ p := by
      cases h with
      | inl hp => exact Or.inr hp
      | inr hq => exact Or.inl hq

    example (h : p ∨ q) : q ∨ p := by
      rcases h with hp | hq

## cases_type

`cases_type I` searches for a hypothesis `h : type` where `I` has the
form `(I ...)`, and splits the main goal by cases on `h`. `cases_type p`
fails if no hypothesis type has the identifier `I` as its head symbol.

- `cases_type I_1 ... I_n` searches for a hypothesis `h : type` where
  `type` has one or more of `I_1`, ..., `I_n` as its head symbol, and
  splits the main goal by cases on `h`.
- `cases_type* I` repeatedly performs case splits until no more
  hypothesis type has `I` as its head symbol. This shorthand for
  `· repeat cases_type I`.
- `cases_type! p` and `cases_type!* p` skip a hypothesis if the main
  goal would be replaced with two or more subgoals.

Example:

    example (h : a ∧ b ∨ c ∧ d) (h2 : e ∧ f) : True := by
      -- The following tactic destructs all conjunctions and disjunctions in the current context.
      cases_type* Or And

## casesm

`casesm p` searches for the first hypothesis `h : type` where `type`
matches the term `p`, and splits the main goal by cases on `h`. Use
holes in `p` to indicate arbitrary subexpressions, for example
`casesm _ ∧ _` will match any conjunction. `casesm p` fails if no
hypothesis type matches `p`.

- `casesm p_1, ..., p_n` searches for a hypothesis `h : type` where
  `type` matches one or more of the given patterns `p_1`, ... `p_n`, and
  splits the main goal by cases on `h`.
- `casesm* p` repeatedly performs case splits until no more hypothesis
  type matches `p`. This is a more efficient and compact version of
  `· repeat casesm p`. It is more efficient because the pattern is
  compiled once.
- `casesm! p` and `casesm!* p` skip a hypothesis if the main goal would
  be replaced with two or more subgoals.

Example:

    example (h : a ∧ b ∨ c ∧ d) (h2 : e ∧ f) : True := by
      -- The following tactic destructs all conjunctions and disjunctions in the current context.

## cat_disch

## cbv

`cbv` performs simplification that closely mimics call-by-value
evaluation. It reduces terms by unfolding definitions using their
defining equations and applying matcher equations. The unfolding is
propositional, so `cbv` also works with functions defined via
well-founded recursion or partial fixpoints.

`cbv` reduces the goal type (and optionally hypothesis types) using
call-by-value evaluation. For equation goals (`lhs = rhs`), `cbv`
automatically attempts
[`refl`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#refl) after reduction to
close the goal.

`cbv` supports the standard `at` location syntax:

- `cbv` — reduce the goal target
- `cbv at h` — reduce hypothesis `h`
- `cbv at h |-` — reduce hypothesis `h` and the goal target
- `cbv at *` — reduce all non-dependent propositional hypotheses and the
  goal target

`cbv` is not a finishing tactic in general: it may leave a new (simpler)
goal.

The proofs produced by `cbv` only use the three standard axioms. In
particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code
generator.

## check_compositions

For each composition `f ≫ g` in the goal, which internally is

of `f` and `g` and check whether their sources and targets agree with
`X`, `Y`, and `Z` at "instances and reducible" transparency, reporting
any discrepancies.

An example:

    example (j : J) :
        colimit.ι ((F ⋙ G) ⋙ H) j ≫ (preservesColimitIso (G ⋙ H) F).inv =
          H.map (G.map (colimit.ι F j)) := by

      -- We know which lemma we want to use, and it's even a simp lemma, but `rw`
      -- won't let us apply it
      fail_if_success rw [ι_preservesColimitIso_inv]
      fail_if_success rw [ι_preservesColimitIso_inv (G ⋙ H)]
      fail_if_success simp only [ι_preservesColimitIso_inv]

      -- This would work:
      -- erw [ι_preservesColimitIso_inv (G ⋙ H)]

      -- `check_compositions` checks if the two morphisms we're composing are
      -- composed by abusing defeq, and indeed it tells us that we are abusing
      -- definitional associativity of composition of functors here: it prints

## choose

- `choose a b h h' using hyp` takes a hypothesis `hyp` of the form
  `∀ (x : X) (y : Y), ∃ (a : A) (b : B), P x y a b ∧ Q x y a b` for some
  `P Q : X → Y → A → B → Prop` and outputs into context a function
  `a : X → Y → A`, `b : X → Y → B` and two assumptions:
  `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x y) (b x y)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x y) (b x y)`. It also works with
  dependent versions.

- `choose! a b h h' using hyp` does the same, except that it will remove
  dependency of the functions on propositional arguments if possible.
  For example if `Y` is a proposition and `A` and `B` are nonempty in
  the above example then we will instead get `a : X → A`, `b : X → B`,
  and the assumptions `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x) (b x)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x) (b x)`.

The `using hyp` part can be omitted, which will effectively cause
`choose` to start with an `intro hyp`.

Like `intro`, the `choose` tactic supports type annotations to specify
the expected type of the introduced variables. This is useful for
documentation and for catching mistakes early:

    example (h : ∃ n : ℕ, n > 0) : True := by
      choose (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) using h
      trivial

If the provided type does not match the actual type, an error is raised.

Examples:

    example (h : ∀ n m : ℕ, ∃ i j, m = n + i ∨ m + j = n) : True := by
      choose i j h using h
      guard_hyp i : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
      guard_hyp j : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
      guard_hyp h : ∀ (n m : ℕ), m = n + i n m ∨ m + j n m = n
      trivial

    example (h : ∀ i : ℕ, i < 7 → ∃ j, i < j ∧ j < i+i) : True := by
      choose! f h h' using h
      guard_hyp f : ℕ → ℕ
      guard_hyp h : ∀ (i : ℕ), i < 7 → i < f i
      guard_hyp h' : ∀ (i : ℕ), i < 7 → f i < i + i

## clear_value

- `clear_value x...` clears the values of the given local definitions. A
  local definition `x : α := v` becomes a hypothesis `x : α`.

- `clear_value (h : x = _)` adds a hypothesis `h : x = v` before
  clearing the value of `x`. This is short for
  `have h : x = v := rfl; clear_value x`. Any value definitionally equal
  to `v` can be used in place of `_`.

- `clear_value *` clears values of all hypotheses that can be cleared.
  Fails if none can be cleared.

These syntaxes can be combined. For example, `clear_value x y *` ensures
that `x` and `y` are cleared while trying to clear all other local
definitions, and `clear_value (hx : x = _) y * with hx` does the same
while first adding the `hx : x = v` hypothesis.

## closedness

`closedness` is a simple tactic that tries various lemmas to prove that
a set is closed, and reasoning about the closure of sets. It is
implemented using `grind`, and has the same configuration options as
`grind`.

It also exists as a grind attribute, and can be combined with other
grind attributes using `grind only [closedness, ...]`.

## coherence

Use the coherence theorem for monoidal categories to solve equations in
a monoidal equation, where the two sides only differ by replacing
strings of monoidal structural morphisms (that is, associators, unitors,
and identities) with different strings of structural morphisms with the
same source and target.

That is, `coherence` can handle goals of the form
`a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'` where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and
`c = c'` can be proved using `pure_coherence`.

(If you have very large equations on which `coherence` is unexpectedly
failing, you may need to increase the typeclass search depth, using e.g.
`set_option synthInstance.maxSize 500`.)

that the closure of sets are compact.

## compareOfLessAndEq_rfl

This attempts to prove that a given instance of `compare` is equal to
[`compareOfLessAndEq`](./Init/Data/Ord/Basic.html#compareOfLessAndEq) by
introducing the arguments and trying the following approaches in order:

1.  seeing if [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) works
2.  seeing if the `compare` at hand is nonetheless essentially
    [`compareOfLessAndEq`](./Init/Data/Ord/Basic.html#compareOfLessAndEq),
    but, because of implicit arguments, requires us to unfold the defs
    and split the `if`s in the definition of
    [`compareOfLessAndEq`](./Init/Data/Ord/Basic.html#compareOfLessAndEq)
3.  seeing if we can split by cases on the arguments, then see if the
    defs work themselves out (useful when `compare` is defined via a
    `match` statement, as it is for [`Bool`](./Init/Prelude.html#Bool))

## compute_degree

`compute_degree` is a tactic to solve goals of the form

- `natDegree f = d`,
- `degree f = d`,
- `natDegree f ≤ d` (or `<`),
- `degree f ≤ d` (or `<`),
- `coeff f d = r`, if `d` is the degree of `f`.

The tactic may leave goals of the form `d' = d`, `d' ≤ d`, `d' < d`, or
`r ≠ 0`, where `d'` in `ℕ` or
[`WithBot`](./Mathlib/Order/TypeTags.html#WithBot)` ℕ` is the tactic's
guess of the degree, and `r` is the coefficient's guess of the leading
coefficient of `f`.

`compute_degree` applies
[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) to the
left-hand side of all side goals, trying to close them.

The variant `compute_degree!` first applies `compute_degree`. Then it
uses [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) on all
the remaining goals and tries `assumption`.

## congr

Apply congruence (recursively) to goals of the form `⊢ f as = f bs` and
`⊢ f as ≍ f bs`. The optional parameter is the depth of the recursive
applications. This is useful when [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)
is too aggressive in breaking down the goal. For example, given
`⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`, [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)
produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`, while
[`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` 2` produces the intended
`⊢ x + y = y + x`.

## congr

Apply congruence (recursively) to goals of the form `⊢ f as = f bs` and
`⊢ f as ≍ f bs`.

- [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` n` controls the depth of the
  recursive applications. This is useful when
  [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) is too aggressive in breaking
  down the goal. For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`,
  [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and
  `⊢ y = x`, while [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` 2` produces the
  intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.
- If, at any point, a subgoal matches a hypothesis then the subgoal will
  be closed.
- You can use [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` with p (: n)?` to
  call `ext p (: n)?` to all subgoals generated by
  [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr). For example, if the goal is
  `⊢ f '' s = g '' s` then [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` with x`
  generates the goal `x : α ⊢ f x = g x`.

## congr!

`congr!` tries to prove the main goal by repeatedly applying congruence
rules. For example, on a goal of the form `⊢ f a1 a2 ... = f b1 b2 ...`,
`congr!` will make new goals `⊢ a1 = b1`, `⊢ a2 = b2`, ...

`congr!` is a more powerful version of the
[`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) tactic that uses congruence lemmas
(tagged with `@[congr]`), reflexivity rules (tagged with `@[refl]`) and
proof discharging strategies. The full list of congruence proof
strategies is documented in the module
[`Mathlib.Tactic.CongrExclamation`](./Mathlib/Tactic/CongrExclamation.html).
The `congr!` tactic is used by the `convert` and `convert_to` tactics.

- `congr! n`, where `n` is a positive numeral, controls the depth with
  which congruence is applied. For example, if the main goal is
  `n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`, then `congr! 1` results in one goal,
  `⊢ n + n = 2 * n`, and `congr! 2` (or more) results in two
  (impossible) goals
  `⊢ `[`HAdd.hAdd`](./Init/Prelude.html#HAdd.hAdd)` = `[`HMul.hMul`](./Init/Prelude.html#HMul.hMul)
  and `⊢ n = 2`. By default, the depth is unlimited.
- `congr! with x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` names or pattern-matches the
  variables introduced by congruence rules, like
  `rintro x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` would.
- `congr! (config := cfg)` uses the configuration options in `cfg` to
  control the congruence rules (see
  [`Congr!.Config`](./Mathlib/Tactic/CongrExclamation.html#Congr!.Config)).

## congrm

`congrm e` is a tactic for proving goals of the form `lhs = rhs`,
`lhs ↔ rhs`, `lhs ≍ rhs`, or `R lhs rhs` when `R` is a reflexive
relation. The expression `e` is a pattern containing placeholders `?_`,
and this pattern is matched against `lhs` and `rhs` simultaneously.
These placeholders generate new goals that state that corresponding
subexpressions in `lhs` and `rhs` are equal. If the placeholders have
names, such as `?m`, then the new goals are given tags with those names.

Examples:

``` lean
example {a b c d : ℕ} :
    Nat.pred a.succ * (d + (c + a.pred)) = Nat.pred b.succ * (b + (c + d.pred)) := by
  congrm Nat.pred (Nat.succ ?h1) * (?h2 + ?h3)
  /-  Goals left:
  case h1 ⊢ a = b
  case h2 ⊢ d = b
  case h3 ⊢ c + a.pred = c + d.pred
  -/
  sorry
  sorry
  sorry

example {a b : ℕ} (h : a = b) : (fun y : ℕ => ∀ z, a + a = z) = (fun x => ∀ z, b + a = z) := by
  congrm fun x => ∀ w, ?_ + a = w
  -- ⊢ a = b
  exact h
```

The `congrm` command is a convenient frontend to `congr(...)` congruence
quotations. If the goal is an equality, `congrm e` is equivalent to
`refine congr(e')` where `e'` is built from `e` by replacing each
placeholder `?m` by `$(?m)`. The pattern `e` is allowed to contain
`$(...)` expressions to immediately substitute equality proofs into the
congruence, just like for congruence quotations.

## constructor

solves it with the first matching constructor, or else fails.

Tags:  

Defined in module:  
[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.constructor)

## constructorm

`constructorm p_1, ..., p_n`, where the main goal has type `type`,
applies the first matching constructor for `type`, if `type` matches one
of the given patterns. If `type` does not match any of the patterns,
`constructorm` fails.

- `constructorm* p_1, ..., p_n` repeatedly applies a constructor until
  the goal no longer matches `p_1`, ..., `p_n`. This is a more efficient
  and compact version of `· repeat constructorm p_1, ..., p_n`. It is
  more efficient because the pattern is compiled once.

Examples:

    example : True ∧ (True ∨ True) := by
      constructorm* _ ∨ _, _ ∧ _, True

## continuity

`continuity` solves goals of the form
[`Continuous`](./Mathlib/Topology/Defs/Basic.html#Continuous)` f` by
applying lemmas tagged with the attribute `@[continuity]`. If the goal
is not solved after attempting all rules, `continuity` fails.

`fun_prop` is a (usually more powerful) alternative to `continuity`.

This tactic is extensible. Tagging lemmas with the `@[continuity]`
attribute can allow `continuity` to solve more goals.

- `continuity?` reports the proof script found by `continuity`.

## contradiction

`contradiction` closes the main goal if its hypotheses are "trivially
contradictory".

- Inductive type/family with no applicable constructors

  ``` lean
  example (h : False) : p := by contradiction

- Injectivity of constructors

  ``` lean
  example (h : none = some true) : p := by contradiction  --
  ```

- Decidable false proposition

  ``` lean
  example (h : 2 + 2 = 3) : p := by contradiction
  ```

- Contradictory hypotheses

  ``` lean
  example (h : p) (h' : ¬ p) : q := by contradiction
  ```

- Other simple contradictions such as

  ``` lean
  example (x : Nat) (h : x ≠ x) : p := by contradiction
  ```

## contrapose

`contrapose` transforms the main goal into its contrapositive. If the
goal has the form `⊢ P → Q`, then `contrapose` turns it into
`⊢ ¬ Q → ¬ P`. If the goal has the form `⊢ P ↔ Q`, then `contrapose`
turns it into `⊢ ¬ P ↔ ¬ Q`.

- `contrapose h` on a goal of the form `h : P ⊢ Q` turns the goal into
  `h : ¬ Q ⊢ ¬ P`. This is equivalent to
  `revert h; contrapose; intro h`.
- `contrapose h with new_h` uses the name `new_h` for the introduced
  hypothesis. This is equivalent to `revert h; contrapose; intro new_h`.
- `contrapose!`, `contrapose! h` and `contrapose! h with new_h` push
  negation deeper into the goal after contraposing (but before
  introducing the new hypothesis). See the
  `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not) tactic for more details on the
  pushing algorithm.
- `contrapose! (config := cfg)` controls the options for negation
  pushing. All options for
  [`Mathlib.Tactic.Push.Config`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Push.html#Mathlib.Tactic.Push.Config)
  are supported:
  - `contrapose! +distrib` rewrites `¬ (p ∧ q)` into `¬ p ∨ ¬ q` instead
    of `p → ¬ q`.

Examples:

``` lean4
variables (P Q R : Prop)

example (H : ¬ Q → ¬ P) : P → Q := by
  contrapose
  exact H

example (H : ¬ P ↔ ¬ Q) : P ↔ Q := by
  contrapose
  exact H

example (H : ¬ Q → ¬ P) (h : P) : Q := by
  contrapose h
  exact H h

## conv

`conv => ...` allows the user to perform targeted rewriting on a goal or
hypothesis, by focusing on particular subexpressions.

See <https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/conv.html> for more
details.

Basic forms:

- `conv => cs` will rewrite the goal with conv tactics `cs`.
- `conv at h => cs` will rewrite hypothesis `h`.
- `conv in pat => cs` will rewrite the first subexpression matching
  `pat` (see `pattern`).

side of the target.

In general, for an `n`-ary operator as the target, it traverses into the
second to last argument. It is a synonym for `conv => arg -2; cs`.

- `conv_lhs at h => cs` runs `cs` on the left hand side of hypothesis
  `h`.
- `conv_lhs in pat => cs` first looks for a subexpression matching `pat`
  (see also the `pattern` conv tactic) and then traverses into the left
  hand side of this subexpression. This syntax also supports the `occs`
  clause for the pattern.

- `conv_rhs at h => cs` runs `cs` on the right hand side of hypothesis
  `h`.
- `conv_rhs in pat => cs` first looks for a subexpression matching `pat`
  (see the `pattern` conv tactic) and then traverses into the right hand
  side of this subexpression. This syntax also supports the `occs`
  clause for the pattern.

## convert

`convert e`, where the term `e` is inferred to have type `t`, replaces
the main goal `⊢ t'` with new goals for proving the equality `t' = t`
using congruence. The goals are created like `congr!` would. Like
`refine e`, any holes (`?_` or `?x`) in `e` that are not solved by
unification are converted into new goals, using the hole's name, if any,
as the goal case name. Like `congr!`, `convert` introduces variables
while applying congruence rules. These can be pattern-matched, like
`rintro` would, using the `with` keyword.

See also `convert_to t`, where `t` specifies the expected type, instead
of a proof term of type `t`. In other words, `convert_to t` works like
`convert (?_ : t)`. Both tactics use the same options.

- `convert! e` uses default transparency, rather than reducible, when
  solving side goals, and it tries to apply congruence even if the two
  expressions do not have the same head constant.
- `convert ← e` creates equality goals in the opposite direction (with
  the goal type on the right).
- `convert e using n`, where `n` is a numeral, controls the depth with
  which congruence is applied. For example, if the main goal is
  `⊢ `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` (n + n + 1)`
  and
  `e : `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` (2 * n + 1)`,
  then `convert e using 2` results in one goal, `⊢ n + n = 2 * n`, and
  `convert e using 3` (or more) results in two (impossible) goals
  `⊢ `[`HAdd.hAdd`](./Init/Prelude.html#HAdd.hAdd)` = `[`HMul.hMul`](./Init/Prelude.html#HMul.hMul)
  and `⊢ n = 2`. By default, the depth is unlimited.
- `convert e with x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` names or pattern-matches the
  variables introduced by congruence rules, like
  `rintro x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` would.
- `convert (config := cfg) e` uses the configuration options in `cfg` to
  control the congruence rules (see
  [`Congr!.Config`](./Mathlib/Tactic/CongrExclamation.html#Congr!.Config)).

Examples:

``` lean
example {n : ℕ} (e : Prime (2 * n + 1)) :
    Prime (n + n + 1) := by
  convert e
  -- One goal: ⊢ n + n = 2 * n
  ring

-- `convert` can fail where `exact` succeeds.
def p (n : ℕ) := True
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by
  fail_if_success
    convert h -- fails, left-over goal 1 = 0
    done
  exact h -- succeeds

-- `convert with` names introduced variables.
example (p q : Nat → Prop) (h : ∀ ε > 0, p ε) :
    ∀ ε > 0, q ε := by
  convert h with ε hε
  -- Goal now looks like:
  -- hε : ε > 0
  -- ⊢ q ε ↔ p ε

## convert_to

`convert_to t` on a goal `⊢ t'` changes the goal to `⊢ t` and adds new
goals for proving the equality `t' = t` using congruence. The goals are
created like `congr!` would. Any remaining congruence goals come before
the main goal. Like `refine e`, any holes (`?_` or `?x`) in `t` that are
not solved by unification are converted into new goals, using the hole's
name, if any, as the goal case name. Like `congr!`, `convert_to`
introduces variables while applying congruence rules. These can be
pattern-matched, like `rintro` would, using the `with` keyword.

`convert e`, where `e` is a term of type `t`, uses `e` to close the new
main goal. In other words, `convert e` works like
`convert_to t; refine e`. Both tactics use the same options.

- `convert_to! t` uses default transparency, rather than reducible, when
  solving side goals.
- `convert_to ty at h` changes the type of the local hypothesis `h` to
  `ty`. If later local hypotheses or the goal depend on `h`, then
  `convert_to t at h` may leave a copy of `h`.
- `convert_to ← t` creates equality goals in the opposite direction
  (with the original goal type on the right).
- `convert_to t using n`, where `n` is a positive numeral, controls the
  depth with which congruence is applied. For example, if the main goal
  is
  `⊢ `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` (n + n + 1)`,
  then
  `convert_to `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` (2 * n + 1) using 2`
  results in one goal, `⊢ n + n = 2 * n`, and
  `convert_to `[`Prime`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Prime/Defs.html#Prime)` (2 * n + 1) using 3`
  (or more) results in two (impossible) goals
  `⊢ `[`HAdd.hAdd`](./Init/Prelude.html#HAdd.hAdd)` = `[`HMul.hMul`](./Init/Prelude.html#HMul.hMul)
  and `⊢ n = 2`. The default value for `n` is 1.
- `convert_to t with x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` names or pattern-matches the
  variables introduced by congruence rules, like
  `rintro x ⟨y₁, y₂⟩ (z₁ | z₂)` would.
- `convert_to (config := cfg) t` uses the configuration options in `cfg`
  to control the congruence rules (see
  [`Congr!.Config`](./Mathlib/Tactic/CongrExclamation.html#Congr!.Config)).

## decide

`decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by
synthesizing an instance of
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` p` and then reducing that
instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`. If it reduces to
`isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables.
If there are local variables, you can first try using the `revert`
tactic with these local variables to move them into the target, or you
can use the `+revert` option, described below.

Options:

- `decide +revert` begins by reverting local variables that the target
  depends on, after cleaning up the local context of irrelevant
  variables. A variable is *relevant* if it appears in the target, if it
  appears in a relevant variable, or if it is a proposition that refers
  to a relevant variable.
- `decide +kernel` uses kernel for reduction instead of the elaborator.
  It has two key properties: (1) since it uses the kernel, it ignores
  transparency and can unfold everything, and (2) it reduces the
  [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) instance only once
  instead of twice.
- `decide +native` uses the native code compiler (`#eval`) to evaluate
  the [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) instance, admitting
  the result via an axiom. This can be significantly more efficient than
  using reduction, but it is at the cost of increasing the size of the
  trusted code base. Namely, it depends on the correctness of the Lean
  compiler and all definitions with an `@[implemented_by]` attribute.
  Like with `+kernel`, the [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)
  instance is evaluated only once.

Limitation: In the default mode or `+kernel` mode, since `decide` uses
reduction to evaluate the term,
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) instances defined by
well-founded recursion might not work because evaluating them requires
reducing proofs. Reduction can also get stuck on
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) instances with
[`Eq.rec`](./Init/Prelude.html#Eq) terms. These can appear in instances
defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`). To avoid this, create
such instances using definitions such as
[`decidable_of_iff`](./Init/PropLemmas.html#decidable_of_iff) instead.

## Examples 

Proving inequalities:

``` lean
example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide
```

Trying to prove a false proposition:

``` lean
example : 1 ≠ 1 := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' proved that the proposition
  1 ≠ 1
is false
-/
```

Trying to prove a proposition whose
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) instance fails to reduce

``` lean
opaque unknownProp : Prop

open scoped Classical in
example : unknownProp := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' failed for proposition
  unknownProp
since its 'Decidable' instance reduced to
  Classical.choice ⋯
rather than to the 'isTrue' constructor.
-/
```

## Properties and relations 

For equality goals for types with decidable equality, usually
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) can be used in place of `decide`.

``` lean
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by decide
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by rfl
```

## decide_cbv

`decide_cbv` is a finishing tactic that closes goals of the form `p`,
where `p` is a [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable) proposition.
It proceeds in two steps:

1.  Apply [`of_decide_eq_true`](./Init/Prelude.html#of_decide_eq_true)
    to transform the goal into `decide p = true`.
2.  Reduce `decide p` via call-by-value normalization. If the result is
    definitionally equal to `true`, the goal is closed.

`decide_cbv` fails with an error if `decide p` does not reduce to
`true`. Unlike `cbv`, `decide_cbv` is a terminal tactic: it either
closes the goal or fails.

The proofs produced by `decide_cbv` only use the three standard axioms.
In particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code
generator.

## decreasing_tactic

`decreasing_tactic` is called by default on well-founded recursions in
order to synthesize a proof that recursive calls decrease along the
selected well founded relation. It can be locally overridden by using
`decreasing_by tac` on the recursive definition, and it can also be
globally extended by adding more definitions for `decreasing_tactic` (or
`decreasing_trivial`, which this tactic calls).

## decreasing_trivial

Extensible helper tactic for `decreasing_tactic`. This handles the "base

extended by adding more macro definitions, e.g.

    macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| linarith)

`simp` but only applies theorems that hold by reflexivity. Thus, the
result is guaranteed to be definitionally equal to the input.

## dsimp!

`dsimp!` is shorthand for `dsimp` with `autoUnfold := true`. This will

## dsimp?

`simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent
call to `simp only` that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is
useful for reducing the size of the simp set in a local invocation to
speed up processing.

    example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
      simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"

This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

that appear in the types of other goals. Note that this can lead to a
failure where there are no goals remaining but there are still
metavariables in the term:

    example (h : ∀ x : Nat, x = x → True) : True := by
      eapply h

## erw?

`erw? [r, ...]` calls `erw [r, ...]` (at hypothesis `h` if written
`erw [r, ...] at h`), and then attempts to identify any subexpression
which would block the use of `rw` instead. It does so by identifying
subexpressions which are defeq, but not at reducible transparency.

## eta_expand

`eta_expand at loc` eta expands all sub-expressions at the given
location. It also beta reduces any applications of eta expanded terms,
so it puts it into an eta-expanded "normal form." This also exists as a
`conv`-mode tactic.

For example, if `f` takes two arguments, then `f` becomes
`fun x y => f x y` and `f x` becomes `fun y => f x y`.

This can be useful to turn, for example, a raw
[`HAdd.hAdd`](./Init/Prelude.html#HAdd.hAdd) into `fun x y => x + y`.

tactic.

The transformation is known as eta reduction for structures, and it
yields definitionally equal expressions.

For example, given `x : α × β`, then `(x.1, x.2)` becomes `x` after this
transformation.

[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.exact)

## exact?

Searches environment for definitions or theorems that can solve the goal
using `exact` with conditions resolved by `solve_by_elim`.

The optional `using` clause provides identifiers in the local context
that must be used by `exact?` when closing the goal. This is most useful
if there are multiple ways to resolve the goal, and one wants to guide
which lemma is used.

Use `+grind` to enable `grind` as a fallback discharger for subgoals.
Use `+try?` to enable [`try?`](./Mathlib/Control/Basic.html#try?) as a
fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `-star` to disable fallback to
star-indexed lemmas (like [`Empty.elim`](./Init/Core.html#Empty.elim),
[`And.left`](./Init/Prelude.html#And.left)). Use `+all` to collect all
successful lemmas instead of stopping at the first.

## expose_names

`expose_names` renames all inaccessible variables with accessible names,
making them available for reference in generated tactics. However, this
renaming introduces machine-generated names that are not fully under
user control. `expose_names` is primarily intended as a preamble for
auto-generated end-game tactic scripts. It is also useful as an
alternative to `set_option tactic.hygienic false`. If explicit control
over renaming is needed in the middle of a tactic script, consider using
structured tactic scripts with `match .. with`, `induction .. with`, or
`intro` with explicit user-defined names, as well as tactics such as
`next`, `case`, and `rename_i`.

## ext

Applies extensionality lemmas that are registered with the `@[ext]`
attribute.

- `ext pat*` applies extensionality theorems as much as possible, using
  the patterns `pat*` to introduce the variables in extensionality
  theorems using `rintro`. For example, the patterns are used to name
  the variables introduced by lemmas such as
  [`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext).
- Without patterns,`ext` applies extensionality lemmas as much as
  possible but introduces anonymous hypotheses whenever needed.
- `ext pat* : n` applies ext theorems only up to depth `n`.

The `ext1 pat*` tactic is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a
single extensionality theorem.

Unused patterns will generate warning. Patterns that don't match the
variables will typically result in the introduction of anonymous
hypotheses.

the `intros` tactic.

## extract_goal

`extract_goal` formats the current goal as a stand-alone theorem or
definition after cleaning up the local context of irrelevant variables.

A variable is *relevant* if (1) it occurs in the target type, (2) there
is a relevant variable that depends on it, or (3) the type of the
variable is a proposition that depends on a relevant variable. If the
target is [`False`](./Init/Prelude.html#False), then for convenience
`extract_goal` includes all variables.

The tactic tries to produce an output that can be copy-pasted and just
work, but its success depends on whether the expressions are amenable to
being unambiguously pretty printed. The tactic responds to pretty
printing options. For example, `set_option pp.all true in extract_goal`
gives the `pp.all` form.

- `extract_goal *` formats the current goal without cleaning up the
  local context.
- `extract_goal a b c ...` formats the current goal after removing
  everything that the given variables `a`, `b`, `c`, ... do not depend
  on.
- `extract_goal ... using name` uses the name `name` for the theorem or
  definition rather than the autogenerated name.

## extract_lets

Extracts `let` and `have` expressions from within the target or a local
hypothesis, introducing new local definitions.

- `extract_lets` extracts all the lets from the target.
- `extract_lets x y z` extracts all the lets from the target and uses
  `x`, `y`, and `z` for the first names. Using `_` for a name leaves it
  unnamed.
- `extract_lets x y z at h` operates on the local hypothesis `h` instead
  of the target.

For example, given a local hypotheses if the form `h : let x := v; b x`,
then `extract_lets z at h` introduces a new local definition `z := v`
and changes `h` to be `h : b z`.

- If the goal is an implication or a function type, introduce the
  argument and restart. (In particular, if the goal is `x ≠ y`,
  introduce `x = y`.)
- Otherwise, for a propositional goal `P`, replace it with `¬ ¬ P`
  (attempting to find a [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)
  instance, but otherwise falling back to working classically) and
  introduce `¬ P`.

[Mathlib.Tactic.Constructor](./Mathlib/Tactic/Constructor.html#tacticFconstructor)

## field

`field` solves equality goals in (semi-)fields. The goal must be an
equality which is *universal*, in the sense that it is true in any field
in which the appropriate denominators don't vanish. (That is, it is a
consequence purely of the field axioms.)

The `field` tactic is built from the tactics `field_simp` (which clears
the denominators) and `ring` (which proves equality goals universally
true in commutative (semi-)rings). If `field` fails to prove your goal,
you may still be able to prove your goal by running the `field_simp` and
`ring_nf` normalizations in some order.

The tactic will try discharge proofs of nonzeroness of denominators, and
skip steps if discharging fails. These denominators are made out of
denominators appearing in the input expression, by repeatedly taking
products or divisors. The default discharger can be non-universal, i.e.
can be specific to the field at hand (order properties, explicit `≠ 0`
hypotheses, [`CharZero`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharZero/Defs.html#CharZero)
if that is known, etc). See
[`Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.discharge`](./Mathlib/Tactic/FieldSimp/Discharger.html#Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.discharge)
for full details of the default discharger algorithm.

- `field (disch := tac)` uses the tactic sequence `tac` to discharge
  nonzeroness proofs.
- `field [t₁, ..., tₙ]` provides terms `t₁`, ..., `tₙ` to the discharger
  for nonzeroness proofs.

Examples:

    example {x y : ℚ} (hx : x + y ≠ 0) : x / (x + y) + y / (x + y) = 1 := by field
    example {a b : ℝ} (ha : a ≠ 0) : a / (a * b) - 1 / b = 0 := by field

    -- The user can also provide additional terms to help with nonzeroness proofs:
    example {K : Type*} [Field K] (hK : ∀ x : K, x ^ 2 + 1 ≠ 0) (x : K) :
        1 / (x ^ 2 + 1) + x ^ 2 / (x ^ 2 + 1) = 1 := by
      field [hK]

    example {a b : ℚ} (H : b + a ≠ 0) : a / (a + b) + b / (b + a) = 1 := by
      -- `field` cannot prove this on its own.
      fail_if_success field
      -- But running `ring_nf` and `field_simp` in a different order works:
      ring_nf at *
      field

Defined in module:  
[Mathlib.Tactic.Field](./Mathlib/Tactic/Field.html#Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.field)

## field_simp

`field_simp` normalizes expressions in (semi-)fields (i.e., does not
require additive inverses) by rewriting them to a common denominator,
i.e. to reduce them to expressions of the form `n / d` where neither `n`
nor `d` contains any division symbol. The `field_simp` tactic will also
clear denominators in field *(in)equalities*, by cross-multiplying.

A very common pattern is `field_simp; ring` (clear denominators, then
the resulting goal is solvable by the axioms of a commutative ring). The
finishing tactic `field` is a shorthand for this pattern.

The tactic will try discharge proofs of nonzeroness of denominators, and
skip steps if discharging fails. These denominators are made out of
denominators appearing in the input expression, by repeatedly taking
products or divisors. The default discharger can be non-universal, i.e.
can be specific to the field at hand (order properties, explicit `≠ 0`
hypotheses, [`CharZero`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharZero/Defs.html#CharZero)
if that is known, etc). See `field_simp_discharge` for full details of
the default discharger algorithm.

- `field_simp at l1 l2 ...` can be used to normalize at the given
  locations.
- `field_simp (disch := tac)` uses the tactic sequence `tac` to
  discharge nonzeroness/positivity proofs.
- `field_simp [t₁, ..., tₙ]` provides terms `t₁`, ..., `tₙ` to the
  discharger for nonzeroness/positivity proofs.

Examples:

    -- `x / (1 - y) / (1 + y / (1 - y))` is reduced to `x / (1 - y + y)`
    example (x y z : ℚ) (hy : 1 - y ≠ 0) :
        ⌊x / (1 - y) / (1 + y / (1 - y))⌋ < 3 := by
      field_simp
      -- new goal: `⊢ ⌊x / (1 - y + y)⌋ < 3`
      sorry

    -- `field_simp` will clear the `x` denominators in the following equation
    example {K : Type*} [Field K] {x : K} (hx0 : x ≠ 0) :
        (x + 1 / x) ^ 2 + (x + 1 / x) = 1 := by
      field_simp
      -- new goal: `⊢ (x ^ 2 + 1) * (x ^ 2 + 1 + x) = x ^ 2`
      sorry

## field_simp_discharge

Default discharge strategy for `field` and `field_simp`: try to solve

following strategies:

- Use an assumption from the context.
- Use the [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)
  tactic.
- Use the
  [`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity)

- Use the `simp` tactic with `discharge` as discharger and lemmas
  stating:
  - `2 ≠ 0`, `3 ≠ 0`, `4 ≠ 0`
  - `x ≠ 0 → y ≠ 0 → x * y ≠ 0`
  - `a ≠ 0 → a ^ n ≠ 0` (for `n : ℕ` and `n : ℤ`)
  - `↑n + 1 ≠ 0`, if `n : ℕ` and the field has characteristic 0.

If none of the strategies finds a proof for `prop`, the result is
`none`.

## filter_upwards

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ]` replaces a goal of the form `s ∈ f` and
terms `h₁ : t₁ ∈ f, ⋯, hₙ : tₙ ∈ f` with
`∀ x, x ∈ t₁ → ⋯ → x ∈ tₙ → x ∈ s`. The list is an optional parameter,
`[]` being its default value.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ` is a short form for
`{ filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ], intro a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ }`.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] using e` is a short form for
`{ filter_upwards [h1, ⋯, hn], exact e }`.

Combining both shortcuts is done by writing
`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ using e`. Note that in this
case, the `aᵢ` terms can be used in `e`.

## fin_cases

`fin_cases h` performs case analysis on a hypothesis of the form
`h : A`, where `[Fintype A]` is available, or `h : a ∈ A`, where
`A : `[`Finset`](./Mathlib/Data/Finset/Defs.html#Finset)` X`,
`A : `[`Multiset`](./Mathlib/Data/Multiset/Defs.html#Multiset)` X` or
`A : `[`List`](./Init/Prelude.html#List)` X`.

As an example, in

    example (f : ℕ → Prop) (p : Fin 3) (h0 : f 0) (h1 : f 1) (h2 : f 2) : f p.val := by
      fin_cases p; simp
      all_goals assumption

after `fin_cases p; simp`, there are three goals, `f 0`, `f 1`, and
`f 2`.

## fin_omega

`fin_omega` is a preprocessor for `omega` to handle inequalities in
[`Fin`](./Init/Prelude.html#Fin). It rewrites all hypotheses and the
goal, turning statements about addition, subtraction and inequalities in
[`Fin`](./Init/Prelude.html#Fin)` n` into statements that `omega` can
use/solve. Note that this involves a lot of case splitting, so may be
slow.

## find

`find` finds definitions and theorems whose result type matches the
current goal exactly, and prints them as info lines. In other words,
`find` lists definitions and theorems that are `apply`able against the
current goal. `find` will not affect the goal by itself and should be
removed from the finished proof.

For a command or tactic that takes the type to search for as an
argument, see `#find`.

Example:

``` lean
example : True := by
  find
  -- True.intro: True
  -- trivial: True
  -- ...

## finiteness

[`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) proves goals
of the form `*** < ∞` and (equivalently) `*** ≠ ∞` in the extended
nonnegative reals (`ℝ≥0∞`). If the goal cannot be proven,
[`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) prints a
warning and shows its intermediate progress.

This tactic is based on `aesop`. It calls `assumption`, `intros`,
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity), and
any lemma or rule added to the
[`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) ruleset,
except that all `simp` rules are disabled.

This tactic is extensible. By adding more rules,
[`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) can prove
more goals. For example:

- `@[aesop (rule_sets := [finiteness]) safe 50] `[`lemma`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Lemma.html#lemma)` ...`
- `add_aesop_rules safe tactic (rule_sets := [finiteness]) (by ...)`

(Note that a `simp` rule cannot be added this way, since all `simp`
rules are disabled.)

- [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness)` (clause)`
  customizes the `aesop` call using the given clause. See `aesop`
  documentation for detailed explanation. Note that
  [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) disables
  `simp`, so
  [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness)` (add simp [lemma1, lemma2])`
  does not do anything more than a bare
  [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness).
- [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness)` [t₁, ..., tₙ]`
  adds the terms `t₁`, ..., `tₙ` as local hypotheses before applying the
  search rules.
- [`finiteness?`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness?)
  additionally shows the proof that
  [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) found.
- [`finiteness_nonterminal`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness_nonterminal)
  is a version of
  [`finiteness`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Finiteness.html#finiteness) that does
  not report a warning if it fails to close the goal.

## fun_cases

The `fun_cases` tactic is a convenience wrapper of the `cases` tactic
when using a functional cases principle.

The tactic invocation

    fun_cases f x ... y ...`

is equivalent to

    cases y, ... using f.fun_cases_unfolding x ...

where the arguments of `f` are used as arguments to
`f.fun_cases_unfolding` or targets of the case analysis, as appropriate.

The form

    fun_cases f

(with no arguments to `f`) searches the goal for a unique eligible
application of `f`, and uses these arguments. An application of `f` is
eligible if it is saturated and the arguments that will become targets
are free variables.

The form `fun_cases f x y with | case1 => tac₁ | case2 x' ih => tac₂`
works like with `cases`.

Under `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding true` (the default),
`fun_induction` uses the `f.fun_cases_unfolding` theorem, which will try
to automatically unfold the call to `f` in the goal. With
`set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`, it uses `f.fun_cases`
instead.

[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.funCases)

## fun_induction

The `fun_induction` tactic is a convenience wrapper around the
`induction` tactic to use the functional induction principle.

The tactic invocation

    fun_induction f x₁ ... xₙ y₁ ... yₘ

where `f` is a function defined by non-mutual structural or well-founded
recursion, is equivalent to

    induction y₁, ... yₘ using f.induct_unfolding x₁ ... xₙ

where the arguments of `f` are used as arguments to `f.induct_unfolding`
or targets of the induction, as appropriate.

The form

    fun_induction f

(with no arguments to `f`) searches the goal for a unique eligible
application of `f`, and uses these arguments. An application of `f` is
eligible if it is saturated and the arguments that will become targets
are free variables.

The forms `fun_induction f x y generalizing z₁ ... zₙ` and
`fun_induction f x y with | case1 => tac₁ | case2 x' ih => tac₂` work
like with `induction.`

Under `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding true` (the default),
`fun_induction` uses the `f.induct_unfolding` induction principle, which
will try to automatically unfold the call to `f` in the goal. With
`set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`, it uses `f.induct`
instead.

## fun_prop

`fun_prop` solves a goal of the form `P f`, where `P` is a predicate and
`f` is a function, by decomposing `f` into a composition of elementary
functions, and proving `P` on each of those by matching against a set of
`@[fun_prop]` lemmas.

If `fun_prop` fails to solve a goal with the error "No theorems found",
you can solve this issue by importing or adding new theorems tagged with
the `@[fun_prop]` attribute. See the module documentation for
[`Mathlib/Tactic/FunProp.lean`](./Mathlib/Tactic/FunProp.html) for a
detailed explanation.

- `fun_prop (disch := tac)` uses `tac` to solve potential side goals.
  Setting this option is required to solve `ContinuousAt/On/Within`
  goals. Assumptions from the local context are automatically
  discharged.
- `fun_prop [c, ...]` will unfold the constant(s) `c`, ... before
  decomposing `f`.
- `fun_prop (config := cfg)` sets advanced configuration options using
  `cfg : FunProp.Config` (see `FunProp.Config` for details). These
  options can be combined: `fun_prop (config := cfg) (disch := tac) [c]`

Examples:

``` lean
example : Continuous (fun x : ℝ ↦ x * sin x) := by fun_prop
```

``` lean
-- Solving `ContinuousAt`/`Within`/`On` goals might require using dischargers:
example (y : ℝ) (hy : y ≠ 0) : ContinuousAt (fun x : ℝ ↦ 1/x) y := by
  fun_prop

example (y : ℝ) (hy : y ≠ 0) : ContinuousAt (fun x => x * (Real.log x) ^ 2 - Real.exp x / x) y := by
  fun_prop (disch := aesop)

## funext

Apply function extensionality and introduce new hypotheses. The tactic
[`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext) will keep applying the
[`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext) lemma until the goal target is not
reducible to

      |-  ((fun x => ...) = (fun x => ...))

The variant [`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext)` h₁ ... hₙ` applies
[`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext) `n` times, and uses the given
identifiers to name the new hypotheses. Patterns can be used like in the
`intro` tactic. Example, given a goal

      |-  ((fun x : Nat × Bool => ...) = (fun x => ...))

[`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext)` (a, b)` applies
[`funext`](./Init/Core.html#funext) once and performs pattern matching
on the newly introduced pair.

## gcongr

`gcongr` applies "generalized congruence" rules to recursively reduce a
goal of form `⊢ R (f a₁ ... aₙ) (f b₁ ... bₙ)` to (possibly multiple)
goal(s) `⊢ Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ`, keeping only the distinct pairs `aᵢ ≠ bᵢ`, where
`Rᵢ` is a possibly different relation (depending on the precise rule).
The relations `R`, `Rᵢ` can be any two-argument relation, including
`· → ·`.

This tactic is extensible: to add a "generalized congruence" rule, tag a
theorem with the attribute `@[gcongr]`.

If a "generalized congruence" lemma has a side goal, `gcongr` will try
to discharge it using `gcongr_discharger`, which is an extensible tactic
based on
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity). Side
goals not discharged in this way are left for the user.

- `gcongr with x y ... z` names the variables that are introduced by
  descending into binders (for example sums or suprema).
- `gcongr n`, where `n` is a natural number literal, limits the depth of
  the recursive applications. This is useful if `gcongr` is too
  aggressive in breaking down the goal.
- `gcongr t`, where `t` is a term with `?_` holes, performs congruence
  up to the holes in `t`. In other words, `gcongr f ?_` turns a goal
  `⊢ R (f x) (f y)` into `⊢ R x y` (but no further). This is useful if
  `gcongr` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal.

Examples:

    example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a + 1 ≤ b + 1) (h2 : c + 2 ≤ d + 2) :
        x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
      -- LHS and RHS both have the form x ^ 2 * ?_ + ?_
      gcongr
      · -- New goal: ⊢ a ≤ b
        linarith
      · -- ⊢ New goal: c ≤ d
        linarith
    -- Resulting proof term is:
    --   add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left ?_ (Even.pow_nonneg (even_two_mul 1) x)) ?_
    -- where `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left` are generalized congruence lemmas
    -- and the side goal `0 ≤ x ^ 2` is discharged by `gcongr_discharger`.

    example {a b c d x : ℝ} (h : a + c + 1 ≤ b + d + 1) :
        x ^ 2 * (a + c) + 5 ≤ x ^ 2 * (b + d) + 5 := by
      -- Using a pattern to limit the depth.
      gcongr x ^ 2 * ?_ + 5 -- or `gcongr 2`
      -- New goal: ⊢ a + c ≤ b + d
      linarith

    -- Descending into binders (here: ⨆).
    example {f g : ℕ → ℝ≥0∞} (h : ∀ n, f n ≤ g n) : ⨆ n, f n ≤ ⨆ n, g n := by

## generalize_proofs

`generalize_proofs ids* [at locs]?` generalizes proofs in the current
goal, turning them into new local hypotheses.

- `generalize_proofs` generalizes proofs in the target.
- `generalize_proofs at h₁ h₂` generalized proofs in hypotheses `h₁` and
  `h₂`.
- `generalize_proofs at *` generalizes proofs in the entire local
  context.
- `generalize_proofs pf₁ pf₂ pf₃` uses names `pf₁`, `pf₂`, and `pf₃` for
  the generalized proofs. These can be `_` to not name proofs.

If a proof is already present in the local context, it will use that
rather than create a new local hypothesis.

When doing `generalize_proofs at h`, if `h` is a let binding, its value
is cleared, and furthermore if `h` duplicates a preceding local
hypothesis then it is eliminated.

The tactic is able to abstract proofs from under binders, creating
universally quantified proofs in the local context. To disable this, use
`generalize_proofs -abstract`. The tactic is also set to recursively
abstract proofs from the types of the generalized proofs. This can be
controlled with the `maxDepth` configuration option, with
`generalize_proofs (config := { maxDepth := 0 })` turning this feature
off.

For example:

``` lean
def List.nthLe {α} (l : List α) (n : ℕ) (_h : n < l.length) : α := sorry
example : List.nthLe [1, 2] 1 (by simp) = 2 := by
  -- ⊢ [1, 2].nthLe 1 ⋯ = 2
  generalize_proofs h
  -- h : 1 < [1, 2].length
  -- ⊢ [1, 2].nthLe 1 h = 2

## ghost_calc

`ghost_calc` is a tactic for proving identities between polynomial
functions. Typically, when faced with a goal like

``` lean
∀ (x y : 𝕎 R), verschiebung (x * frobenius y) = verschiebung x * y
```

you can

1.  call `ghost_calc`
2.  do a small amount of manual work -- maybe nothing, maybe `rintro`,
    etc
3.  call `ghost_simp`

and this will close the goal.

`ghost_calc` cannot detect whether you are dealing with unary or binary
polynomial functions. You must give it arguments to determine this. If
you are proving a universally quantified goal like the above, call
`ghost_calc _ _`. If the variables are introduced already, call
`ghost_calc x y`. In the unary case, use `ghost_calc _` or
`ghost_calc x`.

`ghost_calc` is a light wrapper around type class inference. All it does
is apply the appropriate extensionality lemma and try to infer the
resulting goals. This is subtle and Lean's elaborator doesn't like it
because of the HO unification involved, so it is easier (and prettier)
to put it in a tactic script.

## grewrite

`grewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses each expression `eᵢ : Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ` (where
`Rᵢ` is any two-argument relation) as a generalized rewrite rule on the
main goal, replacing occurrences of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`. Use
`grewrite [← eᵢ]` to rewrite in the other direction, replacing
occurrences of `bᵢ` with `aᵢ`.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems
associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold
`e`. If `e` has parameters, the tactic will try to fill these in by
unification with the matching part of the target. Parameters are only
filled in once per rule, restricting which later rewrites can be found.
Parameters that are not filled in after unification will create side
goals.

To be able to use `grewrite`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged with
`@[gcongr]`. To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also give
it an [`IsTrans`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#IsTrans) instance.

Rewriting with a strict inequality `a < b` may change a constant in the
goal, such as changing `<` to `≤`. If this is not possible, then `a < b`
is treated the same as `a ≤ b`.

`grw` is like `grewrite` but tries to close the goal afterwards by
"cheap" (reducible) [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl). To rewrite only in
the `n`-th position, use `nth_grewrite n`. `apply_rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]`
is a shorthand for `grewrite +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]`: it
interprets `· → ·` as a relation instead of adding the hypothesis as a
side condition.

- `grewrite [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : R a b` in the reverse
  direction, replacing occurrences of `b` with `a`.
- `grewrite (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as configuration.
  See `GRewrite.Config` for details.
  - To let `grewrite` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
    `grewrite (transparency := default) [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
  - `grewrite +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]` interprets `· → ·` as a
    relation (see `apply_rewrite`).
- `grewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

## grind

`grind` is a tactic inspired by modern SMT solvers. **Picture a virtual
whiteboard**: every time grind discovers a new equality, inequality, or
logical fact, it writes it on the board, groups together terms known to
be equal, and lets each reasoning engine read from and contribute to the
shared workspace. These engines work together to handle equality
reasoning, apply known theorems, propagate new facts, perform case
analysis, and run specialized solvers for domains like linear arithmetic
and commutative rings.

See [the reference manual's chapter on
`grind`](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/4.33.0-rc1/find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=grind-tactic)
for more information.

`grind` is *not* designed for goals whose search space explodes
combinatorially, think large pigeonhole instances, graph‑coloring
reductions, high‑order N‑queens boards, or a 200‑variable Sudoku encoded
as Boolean constraints. Such encodings require thousands (or millions)
of case‑splits that overwhelm `grind`’s branching search.

For **bit‑level or combinatorial problems**, consider using
**`bv_decide`**. `bv_decide` calls a state‑of‑the‑art SAT solver
(CaDiCaL) and then returns a *compact, machine‑checkable certificate*.

### Equality reasoning 

`grind` uses **congruence closure** to track equalities between terms.
When two terms are known to be equal, congruence closure automatically
deduces equalities between more complex expressions built from them. For
example, if `a = b`, then congruence closure will also conclude that
`f a` = `f b` for any function `f`. This forms the foundation for
efficient equality reasoning in `grind`. Here is an example:

    example (f : Nat → Nat) (h : a = b) : f (f b) = f (f a) := by
      grind

### Applying theorems using E-matching 

To apply existing theorems, `grind` uses a technique called
**E-matching**, which finds matches for known theorem patterns while
taking equalities into account. Combined with congruence closure,
E-matching helps `grind` discover non-obvious consequences of theorems
and equalities automatically.

Consider the following functions and theorems:

    def f (a : Nat) : Nat :=
      a + 1

    def g (a : Nat) : Nat :=
      a - 1

    @[grind =]
    theorem gf (x : Nat) : g (f x) = x := by
      simp [f, g]

The theorem `gf` asserts that `g (f x) = x` for all natural numbers `x`.
The attribute `[grind =]` instructs `grind` to use the left-hand side of
the equation, `g (f x)`, as a pattern for E-matching. Suppose we now
have a goal involving:

    example {a b} (h : f b = a) : g a = b := by
      grind

Although `g a` is not an instance of the pattern `g (f x)`, it becomes
one modulo the equation `f b = a`. By substituting `a` with `f b` in
`g a`, we obtain the term `g (f b)`, which matches the pattern `g (f x)`
with the assignment `x := b`. Thus, the theorem `gf` is instantiated
with `x := b`, and the new equality `g (f b) = b` is asserted. `grind`
then uses congruence closure to derive the implied equality
`g a = g (f b)` and completes the proof.

The pattern used to instantiate theorems affects the effectiveness of
`grind`. For example, the pattern `g (f x)` is too restrictive in the
following case: the theorem `gf` will not be instantiated because the
goal does not even contain the function symbol `g`.

    example (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
      grind

You can use the command `grind_pattern` to manually select a pattern for
a given theorem. In the following example, we instruct `grind` to use
`f x` as the pattern, allowing it to solve the goal automatically:

    grind_pattern gf => f x

    example {a b c} (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
      grind

You can enable the option `trace.grind.ematch.instance` to make `grind`
print a trace message for each theorem instance it generates.

You can also specify a **multi-pattern** to control when `grind` should
apply a theorem. A multi-pattern requires that all specified patterns
are matched in the current context before the theorem is applied. This
is useful for theorems such as transitivity rules, where multiple
premises must be simultaneously present for the rule to apply. The
following example demonstrates this feature using a transitivity axiom
for a binary relation `R`:

    opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
    axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

    grind_pattern Rtrans => R x y, R y z

    example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
      grind

By specifying the multi-pattern `R x y, R y z`, we instruct `grind` to
instantiate `Rtrans` only when both `R x y` and `R y z` are available in
the context. In the example, `grind` applies `Rtrans` to derive `R a c`
from `R a b` and `R b c`, and can then repeat the same reasoning to
deduce `R a d` from `R a c` and `R c d`.

Instead of using `grind_pattern` to explicitly specify a pattern, you
can use the `@[grind]` attribute or one of its variants, which will use
a heuristic to generate a (multi-)pattern. The complete list is
available in the reference manual. The main ones are:

- `@[grind →]` will select a multi-pattern from the hypotheses of the
  theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for forwards reasoning). In more
  detail, it will traverse the hypotheses of the theorem from
  left-to-right, and each time it encounters a minimal indexable (i.e.
  has a constant as its head) subexpression which "covers" (i.e. fixes
  the value of) an argument which was not previously covered, it will
  add that subexpression as a pattern, until all arguments have been
  covered.
- `@[grind ←]` will select a multi-pattern from the conclusion of
  theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for backwards reasoning). This
  may fail if not all the arguments to the theorem appear in the
  conclusion.
- `@[grind]` will traverse the conclusion and then the hypotheses
  left-to-right, adding patterns as they increase the coverage, stopping
  when all arguments are covered.
- `@[grind =]` checks that the conclusion of the theorem is an equality,
  and then uses the left-hand-side of the equality as a pattern. This
  may fail if not all of the arguments appear in the left-hand-side.

Here is the previous example again but using the attribute `[grind →]`

    opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
    @[grind →] axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

    example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
      grind

To control theorem instantiation and avoid generating an unbounded
number of instances, `grind` uses a generation counter. Terms in the
original goal are assigned generation zero. When `grind` applies a
theorem using terms of generation `≤ n n`, any new terms it creates are
assigned generation `n + 1 + 1 1`. This limits how far the tactic
explores when applying theorems and helps prevent an excessive number of
instantiations.

#### Key options: 

- `grind (ematch := <num>)` controls the number of E-matching rounds.
- `grind [<name>, ...]` instructs `grind` to use the declaration `name`
  during E-matching.
- `grind only [<name>, ...]` is like `grind [<name>, ...]` but does not
  use theorems tagged with `@[grind]`.
- `grind (gen := <num>)` sets the maximum generation.

### Linear integer arithmetic (`lia`) 

`grind` can solve goals that reduce to **linear integer arithmetic
(LIA)** using an integrated decision procedure called **`lia`**. It
understands

- equalities   `p = 0`
- inequalities  `p ≤ 0`
- disequalities `p ≠ 0`
- divisibility  `d ∣ p`

The solver incrementally assigns integer values to variables; when a
partial assignment violates a constraint it adds a new, implied
constraint and retries. This *model-based* search is **complete for
LIA**.

#### Key options: 

- `grind -lia` disable the solver (useful for debugging)
- `grind +qlia` accept rational models (shrinks the search space but is
  incomplete for ℤ)
- `grind (liaSteps := n)` cap the number of steps performed by the model
  search (the solver becomes incomplete when the threshold is reached)

#### Examples: 

    -- Even + even is never odd.
    example {x y : Int} : 2 * x + 4 * y ≠ 5 := by
      grind

    -- Mixing equalities and inequalities.
    example {x y : Int} :
        2 * x + 3 * y = 0 → 1 ≤ x → y < 1 := by
      grind

    -- Reasoning with divisibility.
    example (a b : Int) :
        2 ∣ a + 1 → 2 ∣ b + a → ¬ 2 ∣ b + 2 * a := by
      grind

    example (x y : Int) :
        27 ≤ 11*x + 13*y →
        11*x + 13*y ≤ 45 →
        -10 ≤ 7*x - 9*y →
        7*x - 9*y ≤ 4 → False := by
      grind

    -- Types that implement the `ToInt` type-class.
    example (a b c : UInt64)
        : a ≤ 2 → b ≤ 3 → c - a - b = 0 → c ≤ 5 := by
      grind

### Algebraic solver (`ring`) 

`grind` ships with an algebraic solver nick-named **`ring`** for goals
that can be phrased as polynomial equations (or disequations) over
commutative rings, semirings, or fields.

*Works out of the box* All core numeric types and relevant Mathlib types
already provide the required type-class instances, so the solver is
ready to use in most developments.

What it can decide:

- equalities of the form `p = q`
- disequalities `p ≠ q`
- basic reasoning under field inverses (`a / b := a * b⁻¹`)
- goals that mix ring facts with other `grind` engines

#### Key options: 

- `grind -ring` turn the solver off (useful when debugging)
- `grind (ringSteps := n)` cap the number of steps performed by this
  procedure.

#### Examples 

    open Lean Grind

    example [CommRing α] (x : α) : (x + 1) * (x - 1) = x^2 - 1 := by
      grind

    -- Characteristic 256 means 16 * 16 = 0.
    example [CommRing α] [IsCharP α 256] (x : α) :
        (x + 16) * (x - 16) = x^2 := by
      grind

    -- Works on built-in rings such as `UInt8`.
    example (x : UInt8) : (x + 16) * (x - 16) = x^2 := by
      grind

    example [CommRing α] (a b c : α) :
        a + b + c = 3 →
        a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 5 →
        a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 7 →
        a^4 + b^4 = 9 - c^4 := by
      grind

    example [Field α] [NoNatZeroDivisors α] (a : α) :
        1 / a + 1 / (2 * a) = 3 / (2 * a) := by
      grind

### Other options 

- `grind (splits := <num>)` caps the *depth* of the search tree. Once a
  branch performs `num` splits `grind` stops splitting further in that
  branch.
- `grind -splitIte` disables case splitting on if-then-else expressions.
- `grind -splitMatch` disables case splitting on `match` expressions.
- `grind +splitImp` instructs `grind` to split on any hypothesis `A → B`
  whose antecedent `A` is **propositional**.
- `grind -linarith` disables the linear arithmetic solver for (ordered)
  modules and rings.

### Additional Examples 

    example {a b} {as bs : List α} : (as ++ bs ++ [b]).getLastD a = b := by
      grind

    example (x : BitVec (w+1)) : (BitVec.cons x.msb (x.setWidth w)) = x := by
      grind

    example (as : Array α) (lo hi i j : Nat) :
        lo ≤ i → i < j → j ≤ hi → j < as.size → min lo (as.size - 1) ≤ i := by

## group

`group` normalizes expressions in multiplicative groups that occur in
the goal. `group` does not assume commutativity, instead using only the
group axioms without any information about which group is manipulated.
If the goal is an equality, and after normalization the two sides are
equal, `group` closes the goal.

For additive commutative groups, use the `abel` tactic instead.

- `group at l1 l2 ...` normalizes at the given locations.

Example:

``` lean
example {G : Type} [Group G] (a b c d : G) (h : c = (a*b^2)*((b*b)⁻¹*a⁻¹)*d) : a*c*d⁻¹ = a := by
  group at h -- normalizes `h` which becomes `h : c = d`
  rw [h]     -- the goal is now `a*d*d⁻¹ = a`
  group      -- which then normalized and closed
```

## grw

`grw [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses each expression `eᵢ : Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ` (where `Rᵢ` is
any two-argument relation) as a generalized rewrite rule on the main
goal, replacing occurrences of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`, then tries to close the
main goal by "cheap" (reducible) [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl). Use
`grw [← eᵢ]` to rewrite in the other direction, replacing occurrences of
`bᵢ` with `aᵢ`.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems
associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold
`e`. If `e` has parameters, the tactic will try to fill these in by
unification with the matching part of the target. Parameters are only
filled in once per rule, restricting which later rewrites can be found.
Parameters that are not filled in after unification will create side
goals.

To be able to use `grw`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged with
`@[gcongr]`. To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also give
it an [`IsTrans`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#IsTrans) instance.

Rewriting with a strict inequality `a < b` may change the goal, such as
changing `<` to `≤`. If this is not possible, then `a < b` is treated
the same as `a ≤ b`.

`grewrite` is like `grw` but does not try to apply
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) afterwards. To rewrite only in the
`n`-th position, use `nth_grw n`. `apply_rw [e₁, ..., eₙ]` is a
shorthand for `grw +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]`: it interprets `· → ·`
as a relation instead of adding the hypothesis as a side condition.

- `grw [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : R a b` in the reverse
  direction, replacing occurrences of `b` with `a`.
- `grw (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as configuration. See
  `GRewrite.Config` for details.
  - To let `grw` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
    `grw (transparency := default) [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
  - `grw +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]` interprets `· → ·` as a relation
    (see `apply_rw`).
- `grw [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

Examples:

``` lean
variable {a b c d n : ℤ}

example (h₁ : a < b) (h₂ : b ≤ c) : a + d ≤ c + d := by
  grw [h₁, h₂]

example (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : a ^ 2 ≡ b ^ 2 [ZMOD n] := by
  grw [h]

example (h₁ : a ∣ b) (h₂ : b ∣ a ^ 2 * c) : a ∣ b ^ 2 * c := by
  grw [h₁] at *
  exact h₂

-- To replace the RHS with the LHS of the given relation, use the `←` notation (just like in `rw`):
example (h₁ : a < b) (h₂ : b ≤ c) : a + d ≤ c + d := by
  grw [← h₂, ← h₁]
```

## guard_expr

Tactic to check equality of two expressions.

- `guard_expr e = e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at reducible
  transparency.
- `guard_expr e =~ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at default
  transparency.
- `guard_expr e =ₛ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are syntactically equal.
- `guard_expr e =ₐ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are alpha-equivalent.

Both `e` and `e'` are elaborated then have their metavariables
instantiated before the equality check. Their types are unified (using
`isDefEqGuarded`) before synthetic metavariables are processed, which
helps with default instance handling.

## guard_hyp

Tactic to check that a named hypothesis has a given type and/or value.

- `guard_hyp h : t` checks the type up to reducible defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :~ t` checks the type up to default defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :ₛ t` checks the type up to syntactic equality,
- `guard_hyp h :ₐ t` checks the type up to alpha equality.
- `guard_hyp h := v` checks value up to reducible defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :=~ v` checks value up to default defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :=ₛ v` checks value up to syntactic equality,
- `guard_hyp h :=ₐ v` checks the value up to alpha equality.

The value `v` is elaborated using the type of `h` as the expected type.

## guard_hyp_nums

`guard_hyp_nums n` succeeds if there are exactly `n` hypotheses and

computes the total number of hypotheses, not the number of visible
hypotheses.

## guard_target

Tactic to check that the target agrees with a given expression.

- `guard_target = e` checks that the target is defeq at reducible
  transparency to `e`.
- `guard_target =~ e` checks that the target is defeq at default
  transparency to `e`.
- `guard_target =ₛ e` checks that the target is syntactically equal to
  `e`.
- `guard_target =ₐ e` checks that the target is alpha-equivalent to `e`.

The term `e` is elaborated with the type of the goal as the expected
type, which is mostly useful within `conv` mode.

## have

The `have` tactic is for adding opaque definitions and hypotheses to the
local context of the main goal. The definitions forget their associated
value and cannot be unfolded, unlike definitions added by the `let`
tactic.

- `have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` if `e` is a term of type
  `t`.
- `have h := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
- `have : t := e` and `have := e` use `this` for the name of the
  hypothesis.
- `have pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to
  `match e with | pat => _`, where `_` stands for the tactics that
  follow this one. It is convenient for types that have only one
  applicable constructor. For example, given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`,
  `have ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`,
  and `h₃ : r`.
- The syntax `have (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to
  `match h : e with | pat => _`, which adds the equation `h : e = pat`
  to the local context.

The tactic supports all the same syntax variants and options as the
`have` term.

## Properties and relations 

- It is not possible to unfold a variable introduced using `have`, since
  the definition's value is forgotten. The `let` tactic introduces
  definitions that can be unfolded.
- The `have h : t := e` is like doing `let h : t := e; clear_value h`.
- The `have` tactic is preferred for propositions, and `let` is
  preferred for non-propositions.
- Sometimes `have` is used for non-propositions to ensure that the
  variable is never unfolded, which may be important for performance
  reasons. Consider using the equivalent `let +nondep` to indicate the
  intent.

## if

In tactic mode, `if t then tac1 else tac2` is alternative syntax for:

    by_cases t
    · tac1
    · tac2

It performs case distinction on `h† : t` or `h† : ¬t`, where `h†` is an
anonymous hypothesis, and `tac1` and `tac2` are the subproofs. (It
doesn't actually use nondependent `if`, since this wouldn't add anything
to the context and hence would be useless for proving theorems. To
actually insert an [`ite`](./Init/Prelude.html#ite) application use
`refine if t then ?_ else ?_`.)

The assumptions in each subgoal can be named.
`if h : t then tac1 else tac2` can be used as alternative syntax for:

    by_cases h : t
    · tac1
    · tac2

It performs case distinction on `h : t` or `h : ¬t`.

You can use `?_` or `_` for either subproof to delay the goal to after
the tactic, but if a tactic sequence is provided for `tac1` or `tac2`
then it will require the goal to be closed by the end of the block.

## impossible

`impossible by t` uses the tactic `t` to prove that the current goal is
impossible to prove.

If the goal is `xs ⊢ P`, the tactic `t` sees the goal `¬(∀ xs, P)`. Any
expression metavariables in the original goal turn into variables in the
context.

Universe parameters of the surrounding declaration are kept fixed (not
abstracted); the `+levels` option turns them into fresh level
metavariables instead. Universe metavariables in the goal are rejected.

The original goal is closed as if `sorry` was used.

## induction

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal, producing one
goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is
replaced by a general instance of that constructor and an inductive
hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor. If
the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element
is reverted and reintroduced afterward, so that the inductive hypothesis
incorporates that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) and a goal
with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `induction n` produces one
goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with
hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target
`Q (Nat.succ a)`. Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically
and are not accessible. You can use `with` to provide the variables
names for each constructor.

- `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the
  resulting variable.
- `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of
  induction that should be used. Here `r` should be a term whose result
  type must be of the form `C t`, where `C` is a bound variable and `t`
  is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
- `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables
  in the local context, generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the
  induction but then introduces them in each goal. In other words, the
  net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
- Given `x : `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat),
  `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂` uses tactic
  `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

## induction'

`induction' x` applies induction on the variable `x` of the inductive
type `t` to the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of
`t`, in which `x` is replaced by that constructor applied to newly
introduced variables. `induction'` adds an inductive hypothesis for each
recursive argument to the constructor. This is a backwards-compatible
variant of the `induction` tactic in Lean 4 core.

Prefer `induction` when possible, because it promotes structured proofs.

- `induction' x with n1 n2 ...` names the introduced hypotheses:
  arguments to constructors and inductive hypotheses. This is the main
  difference with `induction` in core Lean.
- `induction' e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the
  resulting variable.
- `induction' h : e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the
  resulting variable, adding to each goal the hypothesis `h : e = _`
  where `_` is the constructor instance.
- `induction' x using r` uses `r` as the principle of induction. Here
  `r` should be a term whose result type is of the form `C t1 t2 ...`,
  where `C` is a bound variable and `t1`, `t2`, ... (if present) are
  bound variables.
- `induction' x generalizing z1 z2 ...` generalizes over the local
  variables `z1`, `z2`, ... in the inductive hypothesis.

Example:

    open Nat

    example (n : ℕ) : 0 < factorial n := by
      induction' n with n ih
      · rw [factorial_zero]
        simp
      · rw [factorial_succ]
        apply mul_pos (succ_pos n) ih

    -- Though the following equivalent spellings should be preferred
    example (n : ℕ) : 0 < factorial n := by
      induction n
      case zero =>
        rw [factorial_zero]
        simp
      case succ n ih =>
        rw [factorial_succ]
        apply mul_pos (succ_pos n) ih

## inhabit

`inhabit α` tries to derive a
[`Nonempty`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nonempty)` α` instance and then uses it
to make an [`Inhabited`](./Init/Prelude.html#Inhabited)` α` instance. If
the target is a `Prop`, this is done constructively. Otherwise, it uses
[`Classical.choice`](./Init/Prelude.html#Classical.choice).

## injection

The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of
inductive data types are injections. That means that if `c` is a
constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)` and `(c t₂)` are
two terms that are equal then `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too. If `q` is a
proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies
injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂`
placed in the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we
derive `a=c` and `b=d`. To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂` should be
constructor applications of the same constructor. Given
`h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with
types `a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal. The tactic
`injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new
hypotheses.

## injections

`injections` applies `injection` to all hypotheses recursively (since
`injection` can produce new hypotheses). Useful for destructing nested
constructor equalities like `(a::b::c) = (d::e::f)`.

## interval_cases

`interval_cases n` searches for upper and lower bounds on a variable
`n`, and if bounds are found, splits into separate cases for each
possible value of `n`.

As an example, in

    example (n : ℕ) (w₁ : n ≥ 3) (w₂ : n < 5) : n = 3 ∨ n = 4 := by
      interval_cases n
      all_goals simp

after `interval_cases n`, the goals are `3 = 3 ∨ 3 = 4` and
`4 = 3 ∨ 4 = 4`.

You can also explicitly specify a lower and upper bound to use, as
`interval_cases using hl, hu`. The hypotheses should be in the form
`hl : a ≤ n` and `hu : n < b`, in which case `interval_cases` calls
`fin_cases` on the resulting fact
`n ∈ `[`Set.Ico`](./Mathlib/Order/Interval/Set/Defs.html#Set.Ico)` a b`.

You can specify a name `h` for the new hypothesis, as
`interval_cases h : n` or `interval_cases h : n using hl, hu`.

## intro

The syntax `intro.` is deprecated in favor of `nofun`.

Tags:  

Defined in module:  
[Batteries.Tactic.NoMatch](./Batteries/Tactic/NoMatch.html#Batteries.Tactic.introDot)

## intro

Introduces one or more hypotheses, optionally naming and/or
pattern-matching them. For each hypothesis to be introduced, the
remaining main goal's target type must be a `let` or function type.

- `intro` by itself introduces one anonymous hypothesis, which can be
  accessed by e.g. `assumption`. It is equivalent to `intro _`.

- `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual
  hypotheses can be anonymized via `_`, given a type ascription, or
  matched against a pattern:

  ``` lean
  -- ... ⊢ α × β → ...
  intro (a, b)
  -- ..., a : α, b : β ⊢ ...
  ```

- `intro `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) is short for
  `intro h; subst h`, if `h` is an equality where the left-hand or
  right-hand side is a variable.

- Alternatively, `intro` can be combined with pattern matching much like
  `fun`:

  ``` lean
  intro
  | n + 1, 0 => tac
  | ...
  ```

## intros

`intros` repeatedly applies `intro` to introduce zero or more hypotheses
until the goal is no longer a *binding expression* (i.e., a universal
quantifier, function type, implication, or `have`/`let`), without
performing any definitional reductions (no unfolding, beta, eta, etc.).
The introduced hypotheses receive inaccessible (hygienic) names.

`intros x y z` is equivalent to `intro x y z` and exists only for
historical reasons. The `intro` tactic should be preferred in this case.

## Properties and relations 

- `intros` succeeds even when it introduces no hypotheses.

- `repeat intro` is like `intros`, but it performs definitional
  reductions to expose binders, and as such it may introduce more
  hypotheses than `intros`.

- `intros` is equivalent to `intro _ _ … _`, with the fewest trailing
  `_` placeholders needed so that the goal is no longer a binding
  expression. The trailing introductions do not perform any definitional
  reductions.

## Examples 

Implications:

``` lean
example (p q : Prop) : p → q → p := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     a✝¹ : p
     a✝ : q
     ⊢ p      -/
  assumption
```

Let-bindings:

``` lean
example : let n := 1; let k := 2; n + k = 3 := by
  intros
  /- n✝ : Nat := 1
     k✝ : Nat := 2
     ⊢ n✝ + k✝ = 3 -/
  rfl
```

Does not unfold definitions:

``` lean
def AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     f✝ : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven f✝
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) -/
  sorry
```

## introv

`introv` introduces the parameters to a dependent function according to
their parameter name. If the first parameter is not depended on by the
rest of the function type, `introv` with no (remaining) arguments does
nothing.

- `introv h₁ h₂ ...` introduces non-depended-on parameters in between
  sequences of depended-on parameters, using the names `h₁`, `h₂`, ...
  in turn. Use `_` to anonymize a specific hypothesis.

Examples:

    example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → b = a := by
      introv h
      /-
      The goal state is:
      a b : ℕ,
      h : a = b
      ⊢ b = a
      -/
      exact h.symm

    example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → ∀ c, b = c → a = c := by
      introv h₁ h₂
      /-
      The goal state is:
      a b : ℕ,
      h₁ : a = b,
      c : ℕ,
      h₂ : b = c
      ⊢ a = c

## isBoundedDefault

Filters are automatically bounded or cobounded in complete lattices. To
use the same statements in complete and conditionally complete lattices
but let automation fill automatically the boundedness proofs in complete
lattices, we use the tactic `isBoundedDefault` in the statements, in the
form `(hf : f.IsBounded (≥) := by isBoundedDefault)`.

## itauto

`itauto` solves the main goal when it is a tautology of intuitionistic
propositional logic. Unlike `grind` and `tauto!` this tactic never uses
the law of excluded middle (without the `!` option), and the proof
search is tailored for this use case. `itauto` is complete for
intuitionistic propositional logic: it will solve any goal that is
provable in this logic.

- `itauto [a, b]` will additionally attempt case analysis on `a` and `b`
  assuming that it can derive
  [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` a` and
  [`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` b`.
- `itauto *` will case on all decidable propositions that it can find
  among the atomic propositions.
- `itauto!` will work as a classical SAT solver, but the algorithm is
  not very good in this situation.
- `itauto! *` will case on all propositional atoms. *Warning:* This can
  blow up the proof search, so it should be used sparingly.

Example:

``` lean
example (p : Prop) : ¬ (p ↔ ¬ p) := by itauto
```

## iterate

`iterate n tac` runs `tac` exactly `n` times. `iterate tac` runs `tac`
repeatedly until failure.

`iterate`'s argument is a tactic sequence, so multiple tactics can be

``` lean
iterate n
  tac₁
  tac₂

## let

The `let` tactic is for adding definitions to the local context of the
main goal. The definition can be unfolded, unlike definitions introduced
by `have`.

- `let x : t := e` adds the definition `x : t := e` if `e` is a term of
  type `t`.
- `let x := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
- `let : t := e` and `let := e` use `this` for the name of the
  hypothesis.
- `let pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to
  `match e with | pat => _`, where `_` stands for the tactics that
  follow this one. It is convenient for types that let only one
  applicable constructor. For example, given `p : α × β × γ`,
  `let ⟨x, y, z⟩ := p` produces the local variables `x : α`, `y : β`,
  and `z : γ`.
- The syntax `let (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to
  `match h : e with | pat => _`, which adds the equation `h : e = pat`
  to the local context.

The tactic supports all the same syntax variants and options as the
`let` term.

## Properties and relations 

- Unlike `have`, it is possible to unfold definitions introduced using
  `let`, using tactics such as `simp`, `dsimp`, `unfold`, and `subst`.
- The `clear_value` tactic turns a `let` definition into a `have`
  definition after the fact. The tactic might fail if the local context
  depends on the value of the variable.
- The `let` tactic is preferred for data (non-propositions).
- Sometimes `have` is used for non-propositions to ensure that the
  variable is never unfolded, which may be important for performance
  reasons.

## lift

`lift e to t with x` lifts the expression `e` to the type `t` by
introducing a new variable `x : t` such that `↑x = e`, and then
replacing occurrences of `e` with `↑x`. `lift` requires an instance of
the class
[`CanLift`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Lift.html#CanLift)` t' t coe `[`cond`](./Init/Prelude.html#cond),
where `t'` is the type of `e`, and creates a side goal for the lifting
condition, of the form `⊢ `[`cond`](./Init/Prelude.html#cond)` x`,
placing this on top of the goal stack.

Given an instance [`CanLift`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Lift.html#CanLift)` β γ`,
`lift` can also lift `α → β` to `α → γ`; more generally, given
`β : Π a : α, Type*`, `γ : Π a : α, Type*`, and
`[Π a : α, `[`CanLift`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Lift.html#CanLift)` (β a) (γ a)]`,
it automatically generates an instance
[`CanLift`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Lift.html#CanLift)` (Π a, β a) (Π a, γ a)`.

`lift` is in some sense dual to the `zify` tactic. `lift (z : ℤ) to ℕ`
will change the type of an integer `z` (in the supertype) to `ℕ` (the
subtype), given a proof that `z ≥ 0`; propositions concerning `z` will
still be over `ℤ`. `zify` changes propositions about `ℕ` (the subtype)
to propositions about `ℤ` (the supertype), without changing the type of
any variable.

The `norm_cast` tactic can be used after `lift` to normalize introduced
casts.

- `lift e to t using h with x` uses the expression `h` to prove the
  lifting condition [`cond`](./Init/Prelude.html#cond)` e`. If `h` is a
  variable, `lift` will try to clear it from the context. If you want to
  keep `h` in the context, write
  `lift e to t using h with x `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl)` h` (see
  below).
- If `e` is a variable, `lift e to t` is equivalent to
  `lift e to t with e`. The original variable `e` will be cleared from
  the context.
- `lift e to t with x hx` adds `hx : ↑x = e` to the context (and if `e`
  is a variable, does not clear it).
- `lift e to t with x hx h` adds `hx : ↑x = e` and
  `h : `[`cond`](./Init/Prelude.html#cond)` e` to the context (and if
  `e` is a variable, does not clear it). In particular,
  `lift e to t using h with x hx h`, where `h` is a variable, keeps `h`
  in the context.
- `lift e to t with x `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl)` h` adds
  `h : `[`cond`](./Init/Prelude.html#cond)` e` to the context (and if
  `e` is a variable, does not clear it). In particular,
  `lift e to t using h with x `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl)` h`,
  where `h` is a variable, keeps `h` in the context.

Examples:

    def P (n : ℤ) : Prop := n = 3

      lift n to ℕ
      /-

- `lift_lets at h` lifts let expressions at the given local hypothesis.

## liftable_prefixes

Rewrites an equation `f = g` as `f₀ ≫ f₁ = g₀ ≫ g₁`, where `f₀` and `g₀`

are "liftable" (i.e. expressible as compositions of unitors and

## linarith

`linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are
linear (in)equalities. Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by
assuming its negation and proving [`False`](./Init/Prelude.html#False).

In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory
of linear arithmetic over the rationals. While there is some special
handling for non-dense orders like [`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) and
[`Int`](./Init/Data/Int/Basic.html#Int), this tactic is not complete for
these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve goals
over arbitrary types that instantiate
[`CommRing`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Defs.html#CommRing),
[`LinearOrder`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/LinearOrder.html#LinearOrder) and
[`IsStrictOrderedRing`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Order/Ring/Defs.html#IsStrictOrderedRing).

An example:

``` lean
example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
        (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0) : False := by
  linarith
```

`linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the
goal, if applicable. Disequality hypotheses require case splitting and
are not normally considered (see the `splitNe` option below).

`linarith [t1, t2, t3]` will additionally use proof terms `t1, t2, t3`.

`linarith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only the goal (if
relevant), local hypotheses `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`,
`t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

`linarith!` will use a stronger reducibility setting to try to identify
atoms. For example,

``` lean
example (x : ℚ) : id x ≥ x := by
  linarith
```

will fail, because `linarith` will not identify `x` and
[`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id)` x`. `linarith!` will. This can sometimes
be expensive.

`linarith (config := { .. })` takes a config object with five optional
arguments:

- `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic
  equation in the proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options
  include `simp` for basic problems.
- `transparency` controls how hard `linarith` will try to match atoms to
  each other. By default it will only unfold `reducible` definitions.
- If `splitHypotheses` is true, `linarith` will split conjunctions in
  the context into separate hypotheses.
- If `splitNe` is `true`, `linarith` will case split on disequality
  hypotheses. For a given `x ≠ y` hypothesis, `linarith` is run with
  both `x < y` and `x > y`, and so this runs linarith exponentially many
  times with respect to the number of disequality hypotheses. (`false`
  by default.)
- If `exfalso` is `false`, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither
  an inequality nor [`False`](./Init/Prelude.html#False). (`true` by
  default.)
- If `minimize` is `false`, `linarith?` will report all hypotheses
  appearing in its initial proof without attempting to drop
  redundancies. (`true` by default.)
- `restrict_type` (not yet implemented in mathlib4) will only use
  hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful if you have
  e.g. both integer- and rational-valued inequalities in the local
  context, which can sometimes confuse the tactic.

A variant, `nlinarith`, does some basic preprocessing to handle some
nonlinear goals.

The option `set_option trace.linarith true` will trace certain
intermediate stages of the `linarith` routine.

higher-reducibility variant and set the `minimize` flag in the
configuration to control whether greedy minimization is performed.

## linear_combination

The `linear_combination` tactic attempts to prove an (in)equality goal
by exhibiting it as a specified linear combination of (in)equality
hypotheses, or other (in)equality proof terms, modulo (A) moving terms
between the LHS and RHS of the (in)equalities, and (B) a normalization
tactic which by default is ring-normalization.

Example usage:

    example {a b : ℚ} (h1 : a = 1) (h2 : b = 3) : (a + b) / 2 = 2 := by
      linear_combination (h1 + h2) / 2

    example {a b : ℚ} (h1 : a ≤ 1) (h2 : b ≤ 3) : (a + b) / 2 ≤ 2 := by
      linear_combination (h1 + h2) / 2

    example {a b : ℚ} : 2 * a * b ≤ a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 := by
      linear_combination sq_nonneg (a - b)

    example {x y z w : ℤ} (h₁ : x * z = y ^ 2) (h₂ : y * w = z ^ 2) :
        z * (x * w - y * z) = 0 := by
      linear_combination w * h₁ + y * h₂

    example {x : ℚ} (h : x ≥ 5) : x ^ 2 > 2 * x + 11 := by
      linear_combination (x + 3) * h

    example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {a b : R} (h : a = b) : a ^ 2 = b ^ 2 := by
      linear_combination (a + b) * h

    example {A : Type*} [AddCommGroup A]
        {x y z : A} (h1 : x + y = 10 • z) (h2 : x - y = 6 • z) :
        2 • x = 2 • (8 • z) := by
      linear_combination (norm := abel) h1 + h2

    example (x y : ℤ) (h1 : x * y + 2 * x = 1) (h2 : x = y) :
        x * y = -2 * y + 1 := by
      linear_combination (norm := ring_nf) -2 * h2
      -- leaves goal `⊢ x * y + x * 2 - 1 = 0`

The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of
proofs of (in)equalities, given as a sum/difference of coefficients
multiplied by expressions. The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions
(with nonnegativity constraints in the case of inequalities). The
expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving (in)equalities; most
commonly they are hypothesis names `h1`, `h2`, ....

The left and right sides of all the (in)equalities should have the same
type `α`, and the coefficients should also have type `α`. For full
functionality `α` should be a commutative ring -- strictly speaking, a
commutative semiring with "cancellative" addition (in the semiring case,
negation and subtraction will be handled "formally" as if operating in
the enveloping ring). If a nonstandard normalization is used (for
example `abel` or `skip`), the tactic will work over types `α` with less
algebraic structure: for equalities, the minimum is instances of
`[Add α] [IsRightCancelAdd α]` together with instances of whatever
operations are used in the tactic call.

The variant `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` specifies explicitly
the "normalization tactic" `tac` to be run on the subgoal(s) after
constructing the linear combination.

- The default normalization tactic is `ring1` (for equalities) or
  `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.prove{LE,LT}` (for inequalities). These are
  finishing tactics: they close the goal or fail.
- When working in algebraic categories other than commutative rings --
  for example fields, abelian groups, modules -- it is sometimes useful
  to use normalization tactics adapted to those categories
  (`field_simp`, `abel`, `module`).
- To skip normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization
  tactic.
- The `linear_combination` tactic creates a linear combination by adding
  the provided (in)equalities together from left to right, so if `tac`
  is not invariant under commutation of additive expressions, then the
  order of the input hypotheses can matter.

The variant `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the
`n`th power before subtracting the combination `e`. In other words, if
the goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will change the
goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above. This variant is
implemented only for linear combinations of equalities (i.e., not for
inequalities).

## linear_combination'

`linear_combination'` attempts to simplify the target by creating a
linear combination of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the
target. The tactic will create a linear combination by adding the
equalities together from left to right, so the order of the input
hypotheses does matter. If the `norm` field of the tactic is set to
`skip`, then the tactic will simply set the user up to prove their
target using the linear combination instead of normalizing the
subtraction.

Note: There is also a similar tactic `linear_combination` (no prime);
this version is provided for backward compatibility. Compared to this
tactic, `linear_combination`:

- drops the `←` syntax for reversing an equation, instead offering this
  operation using the `-` syntax
- does not support multiplication of two hypotheses (`h1 * h2`),
  division by a hypothesis (`3 / h`), or inversion of a hypothesis
  (`h⁻¹`)
- produces noisy output when the user adds or subtracts a constant to a
  hypothesis (`h + 3`)

Note: The left and right sides of all the equalities should have the
same type, and the coefficients should also have this type. There must
be instances of [`Mul`](./Init/Prelude.html#Mul) and
[`AddGroup`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#AddGroup) for this type.

- The input `e` in `linear_combination' e` is a linear combination of
  proofs of equalities, given as a sum/difference of coefficients
  multiplied by expressions. The coefficients may be arbitrary
  expressions. The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving
  equalities. Most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1, h2, ...`.
- `linear_combination' (norm := tac) e` runs the "normalization tactic"
  `tac` on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
  - The default normalization tactic is `ring1`, which closes the goal
    or fails.
  - To get a subgoal in the case that it is not immediately provable,
    use `ring_nf` as the normalization tactic.
  - To avoid normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization
    tactic.
- `linear_combination' (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th
  power before subtracting the combination `e`. In other words, if the
  goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination' (exp := n) e` will change the
  goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above. This feature is
  not supported for `linear_combination2`.
- `linear_combination2 e` is the same as `linear_combination' e` but it
  produces two subgoals instead of one: rather than proving that
  `(a - b) - (a' - b') = 0` where `a' = b'` is the linear combination
  from `e` and `a = b` is the goal, it instead attempts to prove
  `a = a'` and `b = b'`. Because it does not use subtraction, this form
  is applicable also to semirings.
  - Note that a goal which is provable by `linear_combination' e` may
    not be provable by `linear_combination2 e`; in general you may need
    to add a coefficient to `e` to make both sides match, as in
    `linear_combination2 e + c`.
  - You can also reverse equalities using `← h`, so for example if
    `h₁ : a = b` then `2 * (← h)` is a proof of `2 * b = 2 * a`.

## match_scalars

Given a goal parseable as a linear combination
`⊢ a • x + ... + b • y = c • x + ... + d • y`, `match_scalars` splits up
the goal into equalities of the scalars for each respective atom. This
means the example goal above is replaced by goals `⊢ a = c` (from `x`),
..., `⊢ b = d` (from `y`).

The `module` tactic is equivalent to `match_scalars <;> ring1`.

`match_scalars` can parse into expressions made of the operators `+`,
`-`, `•` and the numeral `0`. Any other subexpressions (including
variables) are treated as atoms. If the goal is an equality in the type
`M`, then `match_scalars` requires an
[`AddCommMonoid`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#AddCommMonoid)` M`
instance. If the goal contains a scalar multiplication
`(a : R) • (x : M)`, this requires a
[`Semiring`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Defs.html#Semiring)` R` and
[`Module`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Module/Defs.html#Module)` R M` instance. If
any of the instances are missing, `match_scalars` fails.

The scalar type for the goals produced by the `match_scalars` tactic is
the largest scalar type encountered; for example, if `ℕ`, `ℚ` and a
characteristic-zero field `K` all occur as scalars, then the goals
produced are equalities in `K` with the appropriate casts (from `ℕ`,
`ℤ`, `ℚ`) and `algebraMap`s (otherwise) inserted. Inserted casts are
simplified by lemmas tagged `@[push_cast]`. If the set of scalar types
encountered is not totally ordered (in the sense that for all rings `R`,
`S` encountered, it holds that either
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra)` R S` or
[`Algebra`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Algebra/Defs.html#Algebra)` S R`), then
`match_scalars` fails.

Examples:

    example [AddCommMonoid M] [Semiring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
        a • x + b • x = (b + a) • x := by
      match_scalars
      -- one goal: `⊢ a * 1 + b * 1 = (b + a) * 1`

    example [AddCommGroup M] [Ring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
        a • (a • x - b • y) + (b • a • y + b • b • x) = x := by
      match_scalars
      -- two goals:
      -- `⊢ a * (a * 1) + b * (b * 1) = 1` (from the `x` atom)
      -- `⊢ a * -(b * 1) + b * (a * 1) = 0` (from the `y` atom)

    example [AddCommGroup M] [Ring R] [Module R M] (a : R) (x : M) :
        -(2:R) • a • x = a • (-2:ℤ) • x := by
      match_scalars
      -- one goal: `⊢ -2 * (a * 1) = a * (-2 * 1)`

## mcases

Like `rcases`, but operating on stateful
[`Std.Do.SPred`](./Std/Do/SPred/SPred.html#Std.Do.SPred) goals. Example:
Given a goal `h : (P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ∧ (Q → R)) ⊢ₛ R`,
`mcases h with ⟨-, ⟨hq | hr⟩, hqr⟩` will yield two goals:
`(hq : Q, hqr : Q → R) ⊢ₛ R` and `(hr : R) ⊢ₛ R`.

That is, `mcases h with pat` has the following semantics, based on
`pat`:

- `pat=□h'` renames `h` to `h'` in the stateful context, regardless of
  whether `h` is pure
- `pat=⌜h'⌝` introduces `h' : φ` to the pure local context if `h : ⌜φ⌝`
  (c.f. `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`)
- `pat=h'` is like `pat=⌜h'⌝` if `h` is pure (c.f.
  `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`), otherwise it is like
  `pat=□h'`.
- `pat=_` renames `h` to an inaccessible name
- `pat=-` discards `h`
- `⟨pat₁, pat₂⟩` matches on conjunctions and existential quantifiers and
  recurses via `pat₁` and `pat₂`.
- `⟨pat₁ | pat₂⟩` matches on disjunctions, matching the left alternative
  via `pat₁` and the right alternative via `pat₂`.

proof mode. That is, given a stateful goal `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ P → T`,
`mintro h` transforms into `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)*, (h : P) ⊢ₛ T`.

Furthermore, `mintro ∀s` is like `intro s`, but preserves the stateful
goal. That is, `mintro ∀s` brings the topmost state variable `s:σ` in
scope and transforms `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ T` (where the entailment is in
[`Std.Do.SPred`](./Std/Do/SPred/SPred.html#Std.Do.SPred)` (σ::σs)`) into
`(hᵢ : Hᵢ s)* ⊢ₛ T s` (where the entailment is in
[`Std.Do.SPred`](./Std/Do/SPred/SPred.html#Std.Do.SPred)` σs`).

Beyond that, `mintro` supports the full syntax of `mcases` patterns
(`mintro pat = (mintro h; mcases h with pat`), and can perform multiple
introductions in sequence.

## mod_cases

`mod_cases h : e % n`, where `n` is a positive numeral and `e` is an
expression of type `ℕ` or `ℤ`, performs a case disjunction on the value
of `e` modulo `n`. If `e : ℤ`, the goal is split into `n` subgoals
containing the new hypotheses `h : e ≡ 0 [ZMOD n]`, ...,
`h : e ≡ n-1 [ZMOD n]` respectively. If `e : ℕ` instead, then the
hypotheses contain `[MOD n]` instead of `[ZMOD n]`.

- `mod_cases e % n`, with `h` omitted, gives the default name `H` to the
  new hypotheses.

## module

Given a goal parseable as a linear combination
`⊢ a • x + ... + b • y = c • x + ... + d • y`, `module` proves the
equalities of the scalars for each respective atom, by ring
normalization. This means the example goal above is solved if `ring` can
prove `⊢ a = c` (from `x`), ..., `⊢ b = d` (from `y`).

`module` is equivalent to `match_scalars <;> ring1`. If `ring1` fails to
prove one of the equalities, you can instead use `match_scalars`
followed by specialized proofs for each scalar.

Examples:

    example [AddCommMonoid M] [CommSemiring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
        a • x + b • x = (b + a) • x := by

That is, `monoidal` can handle goals of the form
`a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'` where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and
`c = c'` can be proved using `monoidal_coherence`.

## move_oper

`move_oper op [a]` repeatedly moves `a` to the far right hand side in
applications of `op`. Here the constant `op` refers to a binary
associative commutative operation, and `a` is any term (potentially with
underscores).

If `a` contains underscores, they are filled in by unification with the
first matching occurrence. Subterms with different values for the
underscores are not matched, unless you repeat `a`.

Currently, `move_oper` supports the operators
[`HAdd.hAdd`](./Init/Prelude.html#HAdd.hAdd) (`· + ·`),
[`HMul.hMul`](./Init/Prelude.html#HMul.hMul) (`· * ·`),
[`And`](./Init/Prelude.html#And) (`· ∧ ·`),
[`Or`](./Init/Prelude.html#Or) (`· ∨ ·`),
[`Max.max`](./Init/Prelude.html#Max.max) and
[`Min.min`](./Init/Prelude.html#Min.min). To support more operations,
add them to
[`Mathlib.MoveAdd.moveOperSimpCtx`](./Mathlib/Tactic/MoveAdd.html#Mathlib.MoveAdd.moveOperSimpCtx).

- `move_add [...]` uses addition as the operation: it abbreviates
  `move_oper HAdd.add [...]`.
- `move_mul [...]` uses multiplication as the operation: it abbreviates
  `move_oper HMul.mul [...]`.
- `move_oper op [← a]` moves the atoms matching `a` to the far left hand
  side instead of the right.
- `move_oper op [a, b, ← c, ← d, ...]` moves multiple atoms
  simultaneously, in the order indicated by the arguments: `c` will
  appear to the left of `d` and `a` will appear to the left of `b`.

## mspec

`mspec` is an `apply`-like tactic that applies a Hoare triple
specification to the target of the stateful goal.

Given a stateful goal `H ⊢ₛ wp⟦prog⟧ Q'`, `mspec foo_spec` will
instantiate `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, match `foo` against `prog`
and produce subgoals for the verification conditions `?pre : H ⊢ₛ P` and
`?post : Q ⊢ₚ Q'`.

- If `prog = x >>= f`, then `mspec Specs.bind` is tried first so that
  `foo` is matched against `x` instead. Tactic `mspec_no_bind` does not
  attempt to do this decomposition.
- If `?pre` or `?post` follow by `.`[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl),
  then they are discharged automatically.
- `?post` is automatically simplified into constituent `⊢ₛ` entailments
  on success and failure continuations.
- `?pre` and `?post.*` goals introduce their stateful hypothesis under
  an inaccessible name. You can give it a name with the `mrename_i`
  tactic.
- Any uninstantiated MVar arising from instantiation of `foo_spec`
  becomes a new subgoal.
- If the target of the stateful goal looks like `fun s => _` then
  `mspec` will first `mintro ∀s`.
- If `P` has schematic variables that can be instantiated by doing
  `mintro ∀s`, for example
  `foo_spec : ∀(n:Nat), ⦃fun s => ⌜n = s⌝⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, then `mspec` will
  do `mintro ∀s` first to instantiate `n = s`.
- Right before applying the spec, the `mframe` tactic is used, which has
  the following effect: Any hypothesis `Hᵢ` in the goal
  `h₁:H₁, h₂:H₂, ..., hₙ:Hₙ ⊢ₛ T` that is pure (i.e., equivalent to some
  `⌜φᵢ⌝`) will be moved into the pure context as `hᵢ:φᵢ`.

Additionally, `mspec` can be used without arguments or with a term
argument:

- `mspec` without argument will try and look up a spec for `x`
  registered with `@[spec]`.
- `mspec (foo_spec blah ?bleh)` will elaborate its argument as a term
  with expected type `⦃?P⦄ x ⦃?Q⦄` and introduce `?bleh` as a subgoal.
  This is useful to pass an invariant to e.g., `Specs.forIn_list` and
  leave the inductive step as a hole.

either the pure or stateful context or pure terms.

## mvcgen

`mvcgen` will break down a Hoare triple proof goal like `⦃P⦄ prog ⦃Q⦄`
into verification conditions, provided that all functions used in `prog`
have specifications registered with `@[spec]`.

### Verification Conditions and specifications 

A verification condition is an entailment in the stateful logic of
[`Std.Do.SPred`](./Std/Do/SPred/SPred.html#Std.Do.SPred) in which the
original program `prog` no longer occurs. Verification conditions are
introduced by the `mspec` tactic; see the `mspec` tactic for what they
look like. When there's no applicable `mspec` spec, `mvcgen` will try
and rewrite an application `prog = f a b c` with the simp set registered
via `@[spec]`.

### Features 

When used like `mvcgen +noLetElim [foo_spec, bar_def, instBEqFloat]`,
`mvcgen` will additionally

- add a Hoare triple specification `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ... ⦃Q⦄` to
  `spec` set for a function `foo` occurring in `prog`,
- unfold a definition `def bar_def ... := ...` in `prog`,
- unfold any method of the
  [`instBEqFloat`](./Init/Data/Float/Float.html#instBEqFloat)` : `[`BEq`](./Init/Prelude.html#BEq)` `[`Float`](./Init/Data/Float/Float.html#Float)
  instance in `prog`.
- it will no longer substitute away `let`-expressions that occur at most
  once in `P`, `Q` or `prog`.

### Config options 

`+noLetElim` is just one config option of many. Check out
[`Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.VCGen.Config`](./Std/Tactic/Do/Syntax.html#Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.VCGen.Config)
for all options. Of particular note is `stepLimit = some 42`, which is
useful for bisecting bugs in `mvcgen` and tracing its execution.

### Extended syntax 

Often, `mvcgen` will be used like this:

    mvcgen [...]
    case inv1 => exact I1
    case inv2 => exact I2
    all_goals (mleave; try grind)

There is special syntax for this:

    mvcgen [...] invariants
    · I1
    · I2
    with grind

When `I1` and `I2` need to refer to inaccessibles (`mvcgen` will
introduce a lot of them for program variables), you can use case label
syntax:

    mvcgen [...] invariants
    | inv1 _ acc _ => I1 acc
    | _ => I2
    with grind

This is more convenient than the equivalent
`· by rename_i _ acc _; exact I1 acc`.

### Invariant suggestions 

`mvcgen` will suggest invariants for you if you use the `invariants?`
keyword.

    mvcgen [...] invariants?

This is useful if you do not recall the exact syntax to construct
invariants. Furthermore, it will suggest a concrete invariant encoding
"this holds at the start of the loop and this must hold at the end of
the loop" by looking at the corresponding VCs. Although the suggested
invariant is a good starting point, it is too strong and requires users
to interpolate it such that the inductive step can be proved. Example:

    def mySum (l : List Nat) : Nat := Id.run do
      let mut acc := 0
      for x in l do
        acc := acc + x
      return acc

    /--
    info: Try this:

## native_decide

`native_decide` is a synonym for `decide +native`. It will attempt to
prove a goal of type `p` by synthesizing an instance of
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` p` and then evaluating it
to `isTrue ..`. Unlike `decide`, this uses `#eval` to evaluate the
decidability instance.

This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler
to the trusted part, and a new axiom will show up in `#print axioms` for
theorems using this method or anything that transitively depends on
them. Nevertheless, because it is compiled, this can be significantly
more efficient than using `decide`, and for very large computations this
is one way to run external programs and trust the result.

``` lean
example : (List.range 1000).length = 1000 := by native_decide

## nlinarith

An extension of `linarith` with some preprocessing to allow it to solve

`linarith` for the available syntax of options, which are inherited by
`nlinarith`; that is, `nlinarith!` and `nlinarith only [h1, h2]` all
work as in `linarith`. The preprocessing is as follows:

- For every subterm `a ^ 2` or `a * a` in a hypothesis or the goal, the
  assumption `0 ≤ a ^ 2` or `0 ≤ a * a` is added to the context.
- For every pair of hypotheses `a1 R1 b1`, `a2 R2 b2` in the context,
  `R1, R2 ∈ {<, ≤, =}`, the assumption `0 R' (b1 - a1) * (b2 - a2)` is
  added to the context (non-recursively), where `R ∈ {<, ≤, =}` is the
  appropriate comparison derived from `R1, R2`.

## noncomm_ring

`noncomm_ring` simplifies expressions in not-necessarily-commutative
rings in the main goal then tries closing it by "cheap" (reducible)
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl). This tactic supports the operators
`+`, `*`, `-`, `^` and `•` (for scalar multiplication by natural numbers
or integers).

If the ring is commutative, prefer the `ring` tactic instead, which is
more powerful and efficient. The tactic is implemented as a combination
of `simp only [...]` and `abel`. The precise invocation of `simp only`
can be customized using the options listed below.

Limitation: numeric powers are unfolded entirely with
[`pow_succ`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#pow_succ) and can easily
exceed the maximum recursion depth.

- `noncomm_ring [h]` adds the term `h` as simplification lemma,
  rewriting from left to right. Multiple arguments can be combined as
  `noncomm_ring [h₁, ..., hₙ]`.
- `noncomm_ring [← h]` adds the term `h` as simplification lemma,
  rewriting from right to left.
- `noncomm_ring [*]` simplifies using all hypotheses in the local
  context.
- `noncomm_ring (config := cfg)` uses `cfg` as configuration for the
  simplification step. See
  [`Lean.Meta.Simp.Config`](./Init/MetaTypes.html#Lean.Meta.Simp.Config)
  for more details.
- `noncomm_ring (discharger := tac)` uses the tactic sequence `tac` to
  discharge assumptions to the simplification lemmas. This only applies
  to user-supplied lemmas, since the default lemmas used by
  `noncomm_ring` do not require a discharger.

Example:

``` lean
example {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b + c + c - b) = 2 * a * c := by
  noncomm_ring

## nontriviality

`nontriviality α` generates a proof of
[`Nontrivial`](./Mathlib/Logic/Nontrivial/Defs.html#Nontrivial)` α` and
adds this as a hypothesis.

The tactic first tries to find a proof of
[`Nontrivial`](./Mathlib/Logic/Nontrivial/Defs.html#Nontrivial)` α`
using instance synthesis. If this fails, it will derive this proof using
`a < b`, `a ≠ b` or `a > b` hypotheses in the local context. Otherwise
it will perform a case split on
[`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton)` α ∨ `[`Nontrivial`](./Mathlib/Logic/Nontrivial/Defs.html#Nontrivial)` α`,
and attempt to prove [`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton)` α`
implies the main goal using `simp [nontriviality]`. If the
[`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton) goal cannot be closed
automatically, `nontriviality` fails.

This tactic is extensible: tag a lemma with `@[nontriviality]` to use it
in the `simp` set for the
[`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton) case. All `@[simp]`
lemmas are automatically used too.

- `nontriviality` (without the argument `α`) infers the type from the
  main goal, if the goal is an (in)equality.
- `nontriviality using h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ` uses `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` as extra
  arguments to `simp` in the
  [`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton) case. This supports
  the typical `simp` argument syntax: `nontriviality using ← h` rewrites
  right-to-left with this argument; `nontriviality using -h` removes a
  lemma from the default `simp` set for this tactic invocation.
  `nontriviality using *` adds all local hypotheses to the `simp` set.

Examples:

    example {R : Type} [OrderedRing R] {a : R} (h : 0 < a) : 0 < a := by
      nontriviality -- There is now a `Nontrivial R` hypothesis available.

## norm_cast

The `norm_cast` family of tactics is used to normalize certain coercions
(*casts*) in expressions.

- `norm_cast` normalizes casts in the target.
- `norm_cast at h` normalizes casts in hypothesis `h`.

The tactic is basically a version of `simp` with a specific set of
lemmas to move casts upwards in the expression. Therefore even in
situations where non-terminal `simp` calls are discouraged (because of
fragility), `norm_cast` is considered to be safe. It also has special
handling of numerals.

For instance, given an assumption

``` lean
a b : ℤ
h : ↑a + ↑b < (10 : ℚ)
```

writing `norm_cast at h` will turn `h` into

``` lean
h : a + b < 10
```

There are also variants of basic tactics that use `norm_cast` to
normalize expressions during their operation, to make them more flexible
about the expressions they accept (we say that it is a tactic *modulo*
the effects of `norm_cast`):

- `exact_mod_cast` for `exact` and `apply_mod_cast` for `apply`. Writing
  `exact_mod_cast h` and `apply_mod_cast h` will normalize casts in the
  goal and `h` before using `exact h` or `apply h`.
- `rw_mod_cast` for `rw`. It applies `norm_cast` between rewrites.
- `assumption_mod_cast` for `assumption`. This is effectively
  `norm_cast at *; assumption`, but more efficient. It normalizes casts
  in the goal and, for every hypothesis `h` in the context, it will try
  to normalize casts in `h` and use `exact h`.

See also `push_cast`, which moves casts inwards rather than lifting them
outwards.

## norm_num

[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) normalizes
numerical expressions in the goal. By default, it supports the
operations `+` `-` `*` `/` `⁻¹` `^` and `%` over types with (at least)
an
[`AddMonoidWithOne`](./Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Defs.html#AddMonoidWithOne)
instance, such as `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`, `ℂ`. In addition to evaluating
numerical expressions,
[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) will use
`simp` to simplify the goal. If the goal has the form `A = B`, `A ≠ B`,
`A < B` or `A ≤ B`, where `A` and `B` are numerical expressions,
[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) will try to
close it. It also has a relatively simple primality prover (available if
you import
[`Mathlib.Tactic.NormNum.Prime`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Prime.html)).

This tactic is extensible. Extensions can allow
[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num) to evaluate
more kinds of expressions, or to prove more kinds of propositions (such
as, primality of natural numbers). See the `@[norm_num]` attribute for
further information on extending
[`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num).

- [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` at l`
  normalizes at location(s) `l`.
- [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` [h1, ...]`
  adds the arguments `h1, ...` to the `simp` set in addition to the
  default `simp` set. All options for `simp` arguments are supported, in
  particular `←`, `↑` and `↓`.
- [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` only` does
  not use the default `simp` set for simplification.
  [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` only [h1, ...]`
  uses only the arguments `h1, ...` in addition to the routines tagged
  `@[norm_num]`.
  [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` only` still
  performs post-processing steps, like `simp only`, use `norm_num1` if
  you exclusively want to normalize numerical expressions.
- [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)` (config := cfg)`
  uses `cfg` as configuration for `simp` calls (see the `simp` tactic
  for further details).

Examples:

``` lean
example : 43 ≤ 74 + (33 : ℤ) := by norm_num
example : ¬ (7-2)/(2*3) ≥ (1:ℝ) + 2/(3^2) := by norm_num

## norm_num1

`norm_num1` normalizes numerical expressions in the goal. It is a basic
version of [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)
that does not call `simp`.

By default, it supports the operations `+` `-` `*` `/` `⁻¹` `^` and `%`
over types with (at least) an
[`AddMonoidWithOne`](./Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Defs.html#AddMonoidWithOne)
instance, such as `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`, `ℂ`. If the goal has the form
`A = B`, `A ≠ B`, `A < B` or `A ≤ B`, where `A` and `B` are numerical
expressions, `norm_num1` will try to close it. It also has a relatively
simple primality prover. :e This tactic is extensible. Extensions can
allow `norm_num1` to evaluate more kinds of expressions, or to prove
more kinds of propositions. See the `@[norm_num]` attribute for further
information on extending `norm_num1`.

- `norm_num1 at l` normalizes at location(s) `l`.

Examples:

``` lean
example : 43 ≤ 74 + (33 : ℤ) := by norm_num1
example : ¬ (7-2)/(2*3) ≥ (1:ℝ) + 2/(3^2) := by norm_num1

## nth_grewrite

`nth_grewrite n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ]` is a variant of `grewrite` that
for each expression `eᵢ : R aᵢ bᵢ` only replaces the `n₁, ..., nₖ`th
occurrence of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`. Use `nth_grewrite n₁ ... nₖ [← eᵢ]` to
rewrite in the other direction, replacing occurrences of `bᵢ` with `aᵢ`.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems
associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold
`e`. If `e` has parameters, the tactic will try to fill these in by
unification with the matching part of the target. Parameters are only
filled in once per rule, restricting which later rewrites can be found.
Parameters that are not filled in after unification will create side
goals.

To be able to use `nth_grewrite`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged
with `@[gcongr]`. To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also
give it an [`IsTrans`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#IsTrans)
instance. Rewriting with a strict inequality `a < b` may change the
strictness of the goal, replacing a goal `_ < _` by `_ ≤ _`. If this is
not possible, then `a < b` is treated as `a ≤ b`.

- `nth_grewrite n₁ ... nₖ [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : R a b` in
  the reverse direction, replacing the `n₁, ..., nₖ`th occurrences of
  `b` with `a`.
- `nth_grewrite (config := cfg) n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as
  configuration. See `GRewrite.Config` for details.
  - To let `nth_grewrite` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
    `nth_grewrite (transparency := default) n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
  - `nth_grewrite +implicationHyp n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ]` interprets
    `· → ·` as a relation.
- `nth_grewrite n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the
  location(s) `l`.

## nth_rewrite

`nth_rewrite` is a variant of `rewrite` that only changes the
`n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ *occurrence* of the expression to be rewritten.
`nth_rewrite n₁ ... nₖ [eq₁, eq₂,..., eqₘ]` will rewrite the
`n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ *occurrence* of each of the `m` equalities `eqᵢ`in that
order. Occurrences are counted beginning with `1` in order of
precedence.

For example,

``` lean
example (h : a = 1) : a + a + a + a + a = 5 := by
  nth_rewrite 2 3 [h]
/-
a: ℕ
h: a = 1
⊢ a + 1 + 1 + a + a = 5
-/
```

Notice that the second and third occurrences of `a` from the left have
been rewritten by `nth_rewrite`.

To understand the importance of order of precedence, consider the
example below

``` lean
example (a b c : Nat) : (a + b) + c = (b + a) + c := by
  nth_rewrite 2 [Nat.add_comm] -- ⊢ (b + a) + c = (b + a) + c
```

Here, although the occurrence parameter is `2`, `(a + b)` is rewritten
to `(b + a)`. This happens because in order of precedence, the first
occurrence of `_ + _` is the one that adds `a + b` to `c`. The
occurrence in `a + b` counts as the second occurrence.

If a term `t` is introduced by rewriting with `eqᵢ`, then this instance
of `t` will be counted as an *occurrence* of `t` for all subsequent
rewrites of `t` with `eqⱼ` for `j > i`. This behaviour is illustrated by
the example below

``` lean
example (h : a = a + b) : a + a + a + a + a = 0 := by
  nth_rewrite 3 [h, h]
/-
a b: ℕ
h: a = a + b
⊢ a + a + (a + b + b) + a + a = 0
-/
```

Here, the first `nth_rewrite` with `h` introduces an additional
occurrence of `a` in the goal. That is, the goal state after the first
rewrite looks like below

``` lean
/-
a b: ℕ
h: a = a + b
⊢ a + a + (a + b) + a + a = 0
-/
```

This new instance of `a` also turns out to be the third *occurrence* of
`a`. Therefore, the next `nth_rewrite` with `h` rewrites this `a`.

## nth_rw

`nth_rw` is a variant of `rw` that only changes the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ
*occurrence* of the expression to be rewritten. Like `rw`, and unlike
`nth_rewrite`, it will try to close the goal by trying
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) afterwards.
`nth_rw n₁ ... nₖ [eq₁, eq₂,..., eqₘ]` will rewrite the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ
*occurrence* of each of the `m` equalities `eqᵢ`in that order.
Occurrences are counted beginning with `1` in order of precedence. For
example,

``` lean
example (h : a = 1) : a + a + a + a + a = 5 := by
  nth_rw 2 3 [h]
/-
a: ℕ
h: a = 1
⊢ a + 1 + 1 + a + a = 5
-/
```

Notice that the second and third occurrences of `a` from the left have
been rewritten by `nth_rw`.

To understand the importance of order of precedence, consider the
example below

``` lean
example (a b c : Nat) : (a + b) + c = (b + a) + c := by
  nth_rewrite 2 [Nat.add_comm] -- ⊢ (b + a) + c = (b + a) + c
```

Here, although the occurrence parameter is `2`, `(a + b)` is rewritten
to `(b + a)`. This happens because in order of precedence, the first
occurrence of `_ + _` is the one that adds `a + b` to `c`. The
occurrence in `a + b` counts as the second occurrence.

If a term `t` is introduced by rewriting with `eqᵢ`, then this instance
of `t` will be counted as an *occurrence* of `t` for all subsequent
rewrites of `t` with `eqⱼ` for `j > i`. This behaviour is illustrated by
the example below

``` lean
example (h : a = a + b) : a + a + a + a + a = 0 := by
  nth_rw 3 [h, h]
/-
a b: ℕ
h: a = a + b
⊢ a + a + (a + b + b) + a + a = 0
-/
```

Here, the first `nth_rw` with `h` introduces an additional occurrence of
`a` in the goal. That is, the goal state after the first rewrite looks
like below

``` lean
/-
a b: ℕ
h: a = a + b
⊢ a + a + (a + b) + a + a = 0
-/
```

This new instance of `a` also turns out to be the third *occurrence* of
`a`. Therefore, the next `nth_rw` with `h` rewrites this `a`.

Further, `nth_rw` will close the remaining goal with
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) if possible.

## observe

`observe hp : p` asserts the proposition `p` as a hypothesis named `hp`,
and tries to prove it using `exact?`. If no proof is found, the tactic
fails. In other words, this tactic is equivalent to
`have hp : p := by exact?`.

- `observe : p` uses the name `this` for the new hypothesis.
- `observe? hp : p` will emit a trace message of the form
  `have hp : p := proof_term`. This may be particularly useful to speed
  up proofs.

## obtain

The `obtain` tactic is a combination of `have` and `rcases`. See
`rcases` for a description of supported patterns.

``` lean
obtain ⟨patt⟩ : type := proof
```

is equivalent to

``` lean
have h : type := proof
rcases h with ⟨patt⟩
```

If `⟨patt⟩` is omitted, `rcases` will try to infer the pattern.

If `type` is omitted, `:= proof` is required.

## omega

The `omega` tactic, for resolving integer and natural linear arithmetic
problems.

It is not yet a full decision procedure (no "dark" or "grey" shadows),
but should be effective on many problems.

We handle hypotheses of the form `x = y`, `x < y`, `x ≤ y`, and `k ∣ x`
for `x y` in [`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) or
[`Int`](./Init/Data/Int/Basic.html#Int) (and `k` a literal), along with
negations of these statements.

We decompose the sides of the inequalities as linear combinations of
atoms.

If we encounter `x / k` or `x % k` for literal integers `k` we introduce
new auxiliary variables and the relevant inequalities.

On the first pass, we do not perform case splits on natural subtraction.
If `omega` fails, we recursively perform a case split on a natural
subtraction appearing in a hypothesis, and try again.

The options

    omega +splitDisjunctions +splitNatSub +splitNatAbs +splitMinMax

can be used to:

- `splitDisjunctions`: split any disjunctions found in the context, if
  the problem is not otherwise solvable.
- `splitNatSub`: for each appearance of `((a - b : Nat) : Int)`, split
  on `a ≤ b` if necessary.
- `splitNatAbs`: for each appearance of
  [`Int.natAbs`](./Init/Data/Int/Basic.html#Int.natAbs)` a`, split on
  `0 ≤ a` if necessary.
- `splitMinMax`: for each occurrence of `min a b`, split on
  `min a b = a ∨ min a b = b` Currently, all of these are on by default.

## on_goal

`on_goal n => tacSeq` creates a block scope for the `n`-th goal and
tries the sequence of tactics `tacSeq` on it.

`on_goal -n => tacSeq` does the same, but the `n`-th goal is chosen by
counting from the bottom.

The goal is not required to be solved and any resulting subgoals are
inserted back into the list of goals, replacing the chosen goal.

## order

`order` solves the main goal if it can be derived from the local

[`PartialOrder`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/PartialOrder.html#PartialOrder) or
[`LinearOrder`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/LinearOrder.html#LinearOrder). Also
supports `⊤`, `⊥` and lattice operations.

This tactic fails if it cannot prove the main goal.

- `order [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses the terms `e₁`, ... `eₙ` as hypotheses, in
  addition to the local context.
- `order only [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses only the terms `e₁`, ... `eₙ` as
  hypotheses (ignoring the local context).

## peel

Peels matching quantifiers off of a given term and the goal and
introduces the relevant variables.

- `peel e` peels all quantifiers (at reducible transparency), using
  `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
- `peel e with h` is `peel e` but names the peeled hypothesis `h`. If
  `h` is `_` then uses `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
- `peel n e` peels `n` quantifiers (at default transparency).
- `peel n e with x y z ... h` peels `n` quantifiers, names the peeled
  hypothesis `h`, and uses `x`, `y`, `z`, and so on to name the
  introduced variables; these names may be `_`. If `h` is `_` then uses
  `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis. The length of the list
  of variables does not need to equal `n`.
- `peel e with x₁ ... xₙ h` is `peel n e with x₁ ... xₙ h`.

There are also variants that apply to an iff in the goal:

- `peel n` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff.
- `peel with x₁ ... xₙ` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff and names them.

Given `p q : ℕ → Prop`, `h : ∀ x, p x`, and a goal `⊢ : ∀ x, q x`, the
tactic `peel h with x h'` will introduce `x : ℕ`, `h' : p x` into the
context and the new goal will be `⊢ q x`. This works with `∃`, as well
as `∀ᶠ` and `∃ᶠ`, and it can even be applied to a sequence of
quantifiers. Note that this is a logically weaker setup, so using this
tactic is not always feasible.

For a more complex example, given a hypothesis and a goal:

    h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
    ⊢ ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε

(which differ only in `<`/`≤`), applying
`peel h with ε hε N n hn h_peel` will yield a tactic state:

    h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
    ε : ℝ
    hε : 0 < ε
    N n : ℕ
    hn : N ≤ n
    h_peel : 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
    ⊢ 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε

and the goal can be closed with `exact h_peel.le`. Note that in this
example, `h` and the goal are logically equivalent statements, but
`peel` *cannot* be immediately applied to show that the goal implies
`h`.

In addition, `peel` supports goals of the form `(∀ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, q x`,
or likewise for any other quantifier. In this case, there is no
hypothesis or term to supply, but otherwise the syntax is the same. So
for such goals, the syntax is `peel 1` or `peel with x`, and after which
the resulting goal is `p x ↔ q x`. The `congr!` tactic can also be
applied to goals of this form using `congr! 1 with x`. While `congr!`
applies congruence lemmas in general, `peel` can be relied upon to only
apply to outermost quantifiers.

Finally, the user may supply a term `e` via `... using e` in order to
close the goal immediately. In particular, `peel h using e` is
equivalent to `peel h; exact e`. The `using` syntax may be paired with
any of the other features of `peel`.

This tactic works by repeatedly applying lemmas such as
[`forall_imp`](./Init/PropLemmas.html#forall_imp),
[`Exists.imp`](./Init/PropLemmas.html#Exists.imp),
[`Filter.Eventually.mp`](./Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.Eventually.mp),
[`Filter.Frequently.mp`](./Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.Frequently.mp),
and
[`Filter.Eventually.of_forall`](./Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.Eventually.of_forall).

## plausible

`plausible` considers a proof goal and tries to generate examples that
would contradict the statement.

Let's consider the following proof goal.

``` lean
xs : List Nat,
h : ∃ (x : Nat) (H : x ∈ xs), x < 3
⊢ ∀ (y : Nat), y ∈ xs → y < 5
```

The local constants will be reverted and an instance will be found for
`Testable (∀ (xs : `[`List`](./Init/Prelude.html#List)` Nat), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))`.
The `Testable` instance is supported by an instance of
`Sampleable (List Nat)`,
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` (x < 3)` and
[`Decidable`](./Init/Prelude.html#Decidable)` (y < 5)`.

Examples will be created in ascending order of size (more or less)

The first counter-examples found will be printed and will result in an
error:

    ===================
    Found problems!
    xs := [1, 28]
    x := 1
    y := 28
    -------------------

If `plausible` successfully tests 100 examples, it acts like admit. If
it gives up or finds a counter-example, it reports an error.

For more information on writing your own `Sampleable` and `Testable`
instances, see `Testing.Plausible.Testable`.

Optional arguments given with `plausible (config := { ... })`

- `numInst` (default 100): number of examples to test properties with
- `maxSize` (default 100): final size argument

Options:

- `set_option trace.plausible.decoration true`: print the proposition

## pnat_to_nat

`pnat_to_nat` shifts all
[`PNat`](./Mathlib/Data/PNat/Notation.html#PNat)s in the context to
[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat), rewriting propositions about them. A
typical use case is `pnat_to_nat; lia`.

## polynomial

`polynomial` solves equalities of
[`Polynomial`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Basic.html#Polynomial)s and
similar types.

Given a goal which is an equality in
[`Polynomial`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Basic.html#Polynomial)` R`
with a commutative ring `R`, `polynomial` turns both sides of the
equation into a normal form by expanding out the brackets. It then
closes the goal if both sides contain the same terms and fails
otherwise. `polynomial_nf` normalizes all subexpressions at a given
location.

Variants of `polynomial` include:

- `polynomial`: normalize both sides of an equation and close the goal
  if they are equal
- `polynomial!`: run `polynomial` at default transparency
- `polynomial_nf`: normalize all subexpression of the goal
- `polynomial_nf at h₁ h₂ ⊢`: normalize all subexpressions at hypotheses
  `h₁` `h₁` and the goal
- `polynomial_nf at *`: normalize all subexpressions of all local
  hypotheses and the goal
- `polynomial_nf!`: run `polynomial_nf` at default transparency

The `polynomial` tactic can be extended to work with algebras other than
[`Polynomial`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Basic.html#Polynomial) using
the attributes `polynomial_infer_base`, `polynomial_pre` and
`polynomial_post`. This is only possible if the base ring can be
inferred from the structure of the type.

Examples:

    example (a : ℚ) : (X + C a) * (X - C a) = X^2 + C (a^2) := by polynomial

    example {P : ℚ[X] → Prop} (h : P (X ^ 2 + X + C 4⁻¹)) : P ((X + C 2⁻¹) ^ 2) := by
      polynomial_nf at h ⊢
      exact h

## polyrith

The `polyrith` tactic is no longer supported in Mathlib, because it
relied on a defunct external service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attempts to prove polynomial equality goals through polynomial
arithmetic on the hypotheses (and additional proof terms if the user
specifies them). It proves the goal by generating an appropriate call to
the tactic `linear_combination`. If this call succeeds, the call to
`linear_combination` is suggested to the user.

- `polyrith` will use all relevant hypotheses in the local context.
- `polyrith [t1, t2, t3]` will add proof terms t1, t2, t3 to the local
  context.
- `polyrith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only local
  hypotheses `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will
  ignore the rest of the local context.

Notes:

- This tactic only works with a working internet connection, since it
  calls Sage using the SageCell web API at
  <https://sagecell.sagemath.org/>. Many thanks to the Sage team and
  organization for allowing this use.
- This tactic assumes that the user has `curl` available on path.

## positivity

[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity) solves
goals of the form `0 ≤ x`, `0 < x` and `x ≠ 0`. The tactic works
recursively according to the syntax of the expression `x`, by attempting
to prove subexpressions are positive/nonnegative/nonzero and combining
this into a final proof. This tactic either closes the goal or fails.

For each subexpression `e`,
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity) will
try to:

- try `@[positivity]`-tagged extensions to recursively prove `e` is
  positive/nonnegative/nonzero based on its subexpressions (see the
  [`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity)
  attribute for more details), or
- try the [`norm_num`](./Mathlib/Tactic/NormNum/Core.html#norm_num)
  tactic to prove `e` is positive/nonnegative/nonzero, or
- try showing `e : t` is nonnegative because there is a
  [`CanonicallyOrderedAdd`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Order/Monoid/Canonical/Defs.html#CanonicallyOrderedAdd)` t`
  instance, or
- use a local hypothesis of the form `0 ≤ e`, `0 < e` or `e ≠ 0`.

This tactic is extensible. See the
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity)
attribute documentation for more details.

- [`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity)` [t₁, …, tₙ]`
  first executes `have := t₁; …; have := tₙ` in the current goal, then
  runs [`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity).
  This is useful when
  [`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity) needs
  derived premises such as `0 < y` for division/reciprocal, or `0 ≤ x`
  for real powers.

Examples:

    example {a : ℤ} (ha : 3 < a) : 0 ≤ a ^ 3 + a := by positivity

    example {a : ℤ} (ha : 1 < a) : 0 < |(3:ℤ) + a| := by positivity

    example {b : ℤ} : 0 ≤ max (-3) (b ^ 2) := by positivity

    example {a b c d : ℝ} (hab : 0 < a * b) (hb : 0 ≤ b) (hcd : c < d) :
        0 < a ^ c + 1 / (d - c) := by
      positivity [sub_pos_of_lt hcd, pos_of_mul_pos_left hab hb]

## pull

`pull c` rewrites the goal by pulling the constant `c` closer to the
head of the expression. For instance, `pull _ ∈ _` rewrites
`x ∈ y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z` into `x ∈ y ∪ zᶜ`. More precisely, the `pull` tactic
repeatedly rewrites an expression by applying lemmas of the form
`... (c ...) = c ...` (where `c` can appear 1 or more times on the left
hand side). `pull` is the inverse tactic to `push`. To extend the `pull`
tactic, you can tag a lemma with the `@[push]` attribute. `pull` works
as both a tactic and a conv tactic.

A lemma is considered a `pull` lemma if its reverse direction is a
`push` lemma that actually moves the given constant away from the head.
For example

- [`not_or`](./Init/PropLemmas.html#not_or)` : ¬ (p ∨ q) ↔ ¬ p ∧ ¬ q` is
  a `pull` lemma, but `not_not : ¬ ¬ p ↔ p` is not.
- `log_mul : log (x * y) = log x + log y` is a `pull` lemma, but
  `log_abs : log |x| = log x` is not.
- [`Pi.mul_def`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Notation/Pi/Defs.html#Pi.mul_def)` : f * g = fun (i : ι) => f i * g i`
  and
  [`Pi.one_def`](./Mathlib/Algebra/Notation/Pi/Defs.html#Pi.one_def)` : 1 = fun (x : ι) => 1`
  are both `pull` lemmas for `fun`, because every `push fun _ ↦ _` lemma
  is also considered a `pull` lemma.

TODO: define a `@[pull]` attribute for tagging `pull` lemmas that are
not `push` lemmas.

- `pull _ ~ _` pulls the operator or relation `~`.
- `pull c at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `pull c at *` rewrites at all hypotheses and the goal.
- `pull (disch := tac) c` uses the tactic `tac` to discharge any
  hypotheses for `@[push]` lemmas.

Examples:

- `pull _ ∈ _` rewrites `x ∈ y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z` into `x ∈ y ∪ zᶜ`.
- `pull (disch := positivity) `[`Real.log`](./Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Log/Basic.html#Real.log)
  rewrites `log a + 2 * log b` into `log (a * b ^ 2)`.
- `pull fun _ ↦ _` rewrites `f ^ 2 + 5` into `fun x => f x ^ 2 + 5`
  where `f` is a function.

## pure_coherence

`pure_coherence` uses the coherence theorem for monoidal categories to
prove the goal. It can prove any equality made up only of associators,
unitors, and identities.

``` lean
example {C : Type} [Category* C] [MonoidalCategory C] :
  (λ_ (𝟙_ C)).hom = (ρ_ (𝟙_ C)).hom := by
  pure_coherence
```

Users will typically just use the `coherence` tactic, which can also
cope with identities of the form
`a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'` where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and
`c = c'` can be proved using `pure_coherence`

## push

`push c` rewrites the goal by pushing the constant `c` deeper into an
expression. For instance, `push _ ∈ _` rewrites `x ∈ {y} ∪ zᶜ` into
`x = y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z`. More precisely, the `push` tactic repeatedly rewrites
an expression by applying lemmas of the form `c ... = ... (c ...)`
(where `c` can appear 0 or more times on the right hand side). To extend
the `push` tactic, you can tag a lemma of this form with the `@[push]`
attribute.

To instead move a constant closer to the head of the expression, use the
`pull` tactic.

`push` works as both a tactic and a conv tactic.

- `push _ ~ _` pushes the (binary) operator `~`, `push ~ _` pushes the
  (unary) operator `~`.
- `push c at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `push c at *` rewrites at all hypotheses and the goal.
- `push +distrib `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not) rewrites `¬ (p ∧ q)`
  into `¬ p ∨ ¬ q` (without `+distrib`, it rewrites it into `p → ¬ q`
  instead).
- `push (disch := tac) c` uses the tactic `tac` to discharge any
  hypotheses for `@[push]` lemmas.

Examples:

- `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not) is the same as `push ¬ _`, and
  it rewrites `¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, δ < ε` into
  `∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ε ≤ δ`. Notably, this preserves the binder names.
- `push _ ∈ _` rewrites `x ∈ {y} ∪ zᶜ` into `x = y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z`.
- `push (disch := positivity) `[`Real.log`](./Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Log/Basic.html#Real.log)
  rewrites `log (a * b ^ 2)` into `log a + 2 * log b`.
- `push fun _ ↦ _` rewrites `fun x => f x ^ 2 + 5` into `f ^ 2 + 5`
- `push ∀ _, _` rewrites `∀ a, p a ∧ q a` into
  `(∀ a, p a) ∧ (∀ a, q a)`.

## push_cast

`push_cast` rewrites the goal to move certain coercions (*casts*)
inward, toward the leaf nodes. This uses `norm_cast` lemmas in the
forward direction. For example, `↑(a + b)` will be written to `↑a + ↑b`.

- `push_cast` moves casts inward in the goal.
- `push_cast at h` moves casts inward in the hypothesis `h`. It can be
  used with extra simp lemmas with, for example,
  `push_cast [Int.add_zero]`.

Example:

``` lean
example (a b : Nat)
    (h1 : ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10)
    (h2 : ((a + b + 0 : Nat) : Int) = 10) :
    ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10 := by
  /-
  h1 : ↑(a + b) = 10
  h2 : ↑(a + b + 0) = 10
  ⊢ ↑(a + b) = 10
  -/
  push_cast
  /- Now
  ⊢ ↑a + ↑b = 10
  -/
  push_cast at h1
  push_cast [Int.add_zero] at h2
  /- Now
  h1 h2 : ↑a + ↑b = 10
  -/
  exact h1
```

See also `norm_cast`.

[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.pushCast)

## push_neg

`push_neg` rewrites the goal by pushing negations deeper into an
expression. For instance, the goal `¬ ∀ x, ∃ y, x ≤ y` will be
transformed by `push_neg` into `∃ x, ∀ y, y < x`. Binder names are
preserved (contrary to what would happen with `simp` using the relevant
lemmas). `push_neg` works as both a tactic and a conv tactic.

`push_neg` is a special case of the more general `push` tactic, namely
`push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not). The `push` tactic can be
extended using the `@[push]` attribute. `push` has special-casing built
in for `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not).

Tactics that introduce a negation usually have a version that
automatically calls `push_neg` on that negation. These include
`by_cases!`, `contrapose!` and `by_contra!`.

- `push_neg at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `push_neg at *` rewrites at each hypothesis and the goal.
- `push_neg +distrib` rewrites `¬ (p ∧ q)` into `¬ p ∨ ¬ q` (by default,
  the tactic rewrites it into `p → ¬ q` instead).

Example:

``` lean
example (h : ¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - y₀| ≤ ε) :
    ∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀| := by
  push_neg at h
  -- Now we have the hypothesis `h : ∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀|`
  exact h
```

## qify

`qify` rewrites the main goal by shifting propositions from `ℕ` or `ℤ`
to `ℚ`. This is often useful since `ℚ` has well-behaved subtraction and
division.

`qify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` and `@[qify_simps]` attributes
to insert casts into propositions, and the `push_cast` tactic to
simplify the `ℚ`-valued expressions.

`qify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic. `lift (q : ℚ) to ℤ`
will change the type of a rational number `q` (in the supertype) to `ℤ`
(the subtype), given a proof that `q.den = 1`; propositions concerning
`q` will still be over `ℚ`. `qify` changes propositions about `ℕ` or `ℤ`
(the subtype) to propositions about `ℚ` (the supertype), without
changing the type of any variable.

- `qify at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `qify [h₁, ..., hₙ]` uses the expressions `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` as extra
  lemmas for simplification. This is especially useful in the presence
  of nat subtraction or of division: passing arguments of type `· ≤ ·`
  or `· ∣ ·` will allow `push_cast` to do more work.

Examples:

    example (a b c x y z : ℕ) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
      qify
      qify at h
      /-
      h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
      ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b
      -/
      sorry

    example (a b c : ℤ) (h : a / b = c) (hab : b ∣ a) (hb : b ≠ 0) : a = c * b := by
      -- Divisibility hypothesis allows pushing `· / ·`.
      qify [hab] at h hb ⊢
      exact (div_eq_iff hb).1 h

## rcases

`rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to
a pattern. It is used to destructure hypotheses or expressions composed
of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
`h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be
`rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
`rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular
local hypothesis (most of which are generated during the execution of
`rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from the input
expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

- A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
- A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system
  used by `cases` name the hypothesis).
- A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
- The keyword [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl), which expects the
  hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the hypothesis
  (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice
  versa).
- A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to
  `ty` and then matches it against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with
  the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
- A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many
  arguments, or a series of nested conjunctions or existentials. For
  example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`, then the conjunction
  will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2`
  against `b` and so on.
- A `@` before a tuple pattern as in `@⟨p1, p2, p3⟩` will bind all
  arguments in the constructor, while leaving the `@` off will only use
  the patterns on the explicit arguments.
- An alternation pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type
  with multiple constructors, or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive
datatype, naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as
`a,b,c` and the first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list
is not as long as the number of arguments to the constructor or the
number of constructors, the remaining variables will be automatically
named. If there are nested brackets such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then
these will cause more case splits as necessary. If there are too many
arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on `∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it
will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last parameter as
necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction
into Prop works like matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the
exception that an assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

## rcongr

Repeatedly apply [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) and `ext`, using
the given patterns as arguments for `ext`.

There are two ways this tactic stops:

- [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) fails (makes no progress), after
  having already applied `ext`.
- [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) canceled out the last usage of
  `ext`. In this case, the state is reverted to before the
  [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) was applied.

For example, when the goal is

    ⊢ (fun x => f x + 3) '' s = (fun x => g x + 3) '' s

then `rcongr x` produces the goal

    x : α ⊢ f x = g x

This gives the same result as
`congr; ext x; `[`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr).

In contrast, [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr) would produce

    ⊢ (fun x => f x + 3) = (fun x => g x + 3)

and [`congr`](./Init/Prelude.html#congr)` with x` (or `congr; ext x`)
would produce

    x : α ⊢ f x + 3 = g x + 3

## recover

`recover tacs` applies the tactic (sequence) `tacs` and then re-adds
goals that were incorrectly marked as closed. This helps to debug issues
where a tactic closes goals without solving them (i.e. goals were
removed from the MetaM state without the metavariable being assigned),
resulting in the error "(kernel) declaration has metavariables".

[Mathlib.Tactic.DefEqTransformations](./Mathlib/Tactic/DefEqTransformations.html#Mathlib.Tactic.tacticReduce__)

## reduce_mod_char

The tactic `reduce_mod_char` looks for numeric expressions in
characteristic `p` and reduces these to lie between `0` and `p`.

For example:

    example : (5 : ZMod 4) = 1 := by reduce_mod_char
    example : (X ^ 2 - 3 * X + 4 : (ZMod 4)[X]) = X ^ 2 + X := by reduce_mod_char

It also handles negation, turning it into multiplication by `p - 1`, and
similarly subtraction.

This tactic uses the type of the subexpression to figure out if it is
indeed of positive characteristic, for improved performance compared to
trying to synthesise a
[`CharP`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Defs.html#CharP) instance. The variant
`reduce_mod_char!` also tries to use
[`CharP`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Defs.html#CharP)` R n` hypotheses in
the context. (Limitations of the typeclass system mean the tactic can't
search for a [`CharP`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Defs.html#CharP)` R n`
instance if `n` is not yet known; use
`have : `[`CharP`](./Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Defs.html#CharP)` R n := inferInstance; reduce_mod_char!`
as a workaround.)

## refold_let

`refold_let x y z at loc` looks for the bodies of local definitions `x`,
`y`, and `z` at the given location and replaces them with `x`, `y`, or
`z`. This is the inverse of "zeta reduction." This also exists as a
`conv`-mode tactic.

## rel

`rel [h₁, ..., hₙ]` uses "generalized congruence" rules to solve a goal
of form `⊢ R (f a₁ ... aₙ) (f b₁ ... bₙ)` by substituting with the terms
`hᵢ : Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ`. The relations `R`, `Rᵢ` can be any two-argument
relation, including `· → ·`.

This tactic is extensible: to add a "generalized congruence" rule, tag a
theorem with the attribute `@[gcongr]`.

If a "generalized congruence" lemma has a side goal, `rel` will try to
discharge it using `gcongr_discharger`, which is an extensible tactic
based on
[`positivity`](./Mathlib/Tactic/Positivity/Core.html#positivity). If
side goals cannot be discharged, or the terms `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` cannot
solve the goals, the tactic fails.

Examples:

    example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a ≤ b) (h2 : c ≤ d) :
        x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
      rel [h1, h2]
    -- In this example we "substitute" the hypotheses `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d` into the LHS `x ^ 2 * a + c`
    -- of the goal and obtain the RHS `x ^ 2 * b + d`, thus proving the goal.
    -- This constructs the proof term:
    --   add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h1 (pow_bit0_nonneg x 1)) h2
    -- using the generalized congruence lemmas `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`.

## rename_bvar

- `rename_bvar old → new` renames all bound variables named `old` to
  `new` in the target.
- `rename_bvar old → new at h` does the same in hypothesis `h`.

``` lean

  rename_bvar n → q at h -- h is now ∀ (q : ℕ), ∃ (m : ℕ), P q m,
  rename_bvar m → n -- target is now ∀ (l : ℕ), ∃ (n : ℕ), P k n,
  exact h -- Lean does not care about those bound variable names
```

## repeat

`repeat tac` repeatedly applies `tac` so long as it succeeds. The tactic
`tac` may be a tactic sequence, and if `tac` fails at any point in its
execution, `repeat` will revert any partial changes that `tac` made to
the tactic state.

The tactic `tac` should eventually fail, otherwise `repeat tac` will run
indefinitely.

See also:

- `try tac` is like `repeat tac` but will apply `tac` at most once.
- `repeat' tac` recursively applies `tac` to each goal.
- `first | tac1 | tac2` implements the backtracking used by `repeat`

## repeat'

`repeat' tac` recursively applies `tac` on all of the goals so long as
it succeeds. That is to say, if `tac` produces multiple subgoals, then
`repeat' tac` is applied to each of them.

- `repeat1' tac` is `repeat' tac` but requires that `tac` succeed for
  some goal at least once.

## replace

`replace h := e` is like `have h := e`, but it removes a previous
hypothesis of the same name as this one if possible. For example, if the
state is:

``` lean
f : α → β
h : α
⊢ goal
```

Then after `replace h := f h` the state will be:

``` lean
f : α → β
h : β
⊢ goal
```

whereas `have h := f h` would result in:

``` lean
f : α → β
h† : α
h : β
⊢ goal
```

The tactic `specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` is a way to write
`replace h := h a₁ ... aₙ`, automatically inferring which hypothesis
should be replaced.

The `replace` tactic can be used to simulate Rocq's `apply at` tactic.

## rewrite

`rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of
the main goal. If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the
rewrite is applied in the reverse direction. If `e` is a defined
constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used.
This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.

- `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
- `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is
  either `*` or a list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter
  case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-` can also be used, to signify the target
  of the goal.

Using `rw (occs := .pos L) [e]`, where
[`L`](./Archive/Hairer.html#L)` : `[`List`](./Init/Prelude.html#List)` `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat),
you can control which "occurrences" are rewritten. (This option applies
to each rule, so usually this will only be used with a single rule.)
Occurrences count from `1`. At each allowed occurrence, arguments of the
rewrite rule `e` may be instantiated, restricting which later rewrites
can be found. (Disallowed occurrences do not result in instantiation.)
`(occs := .neg L)` allows skipping specified occurrences.

## rewrite!

`rewrite!` is like `rewrite`, but can also insert casts to adjust types
that depend on the LHS of a rewrite. It is available as an ordinary
tactic and a `conv` tactic.

The sort of casts that are inserted is controlled by the `castMode`
configuration option. By default, only proof terms are casted; by proof
irrelevance, this adds no observable complexity.

With `rewrite! +letAbs (castMode := .all)`, casts are inserted whenever
necessary. This means that the 'motive is not type correct' error never
occurs, at the expense of creating potentially complicated terms.

## rfl'

smart unfolding and unfolds all kinds of definitions, theorems included
(relevant for declarations defined by well-founded recursion).

Tags:  

Defined in module:  
[Init.Tactics](./Init/Tactics.html#Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRfl')

## rfl_cat

`rfl_cat` is a macro for `intros; `[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl)
which is attempted in `aesop_cat` before doing the more expensive
`aesop` tactic.

This gives a speedup because `simp` (called by `aesop`) can be very
slow. <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25475>
contains measurements from June 2025.

Implementation notes:

- `refine `[`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id)` ?_`: In some cases it is
  important that the type of the proof matches the expected type
  exactly. e.g. if the goal is `2 = 1 + 1`, the
  [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) tactic will give a proof of type
  `2 = 2`. Starting a proof with
  `refine `[`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id)` ?_` is a trick to make sure
  that the proof has exactly the expected type, in this case
  `2 = 1 + 1`. See also
  https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/changing.20a.20proof.20can.20break.20a.20later.20proof
- `apply_rfl`: [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl) is a macro that attempts
  both `eq_refl` and `apply_rfl`. Since `apply_rfl` subsumes `eq_refl`,
  we can use `apply_rfl` instead. This fails twice as fast as
  [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl).

## rify

`rify` rewrites the main goal by shifting propositions from `ℕ`, `ℤ`,
`ℚ` or `ℝ≥0` to `ℝ`. Although less useful than its cousins `zify` and
`qify`, it can be useful when your goal or context already involves real
numbers.

`rify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]`, `@[qify_simps]` and
`@[rify_simps]` attributes to insert casts into propositions, and the
`push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℝ`-valued expressions.

`rify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic. `lift (r : ℝ) to ℚ`
will change the type of a real number `r` (in the supertype) to `ℚ` (the
subtype), given a proof that `r` is rational; propositions concerning
`r` will still be over `ℝ`. `rify` changes propositions about `ℕ`, `ℤ`,
`ℚ` or `ℝ≥0` (the subtype) to propositions about `ℝ` (the supertype),
without changing the type of any variable.

- `rify at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `rify [h₁, ..., hₙ]` uses the expressions `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` as extra
  lemmas for simplification. This is especially useful in the presence
  of nat subtraction or of division: passing arguments of type `· ≤ ·`
  or `· ∣ ·` will allow `push_cast` to do more work.

Examples:

    /--
    import Mathlib

    open Real
    Here, the assumption `hn` is about natural numbers, `hk` is about integers
    and involves casting a natural number to `ℤ`, and the conclusion is about real numbers.
    -/
    example {n : ℕ} {k : ℤ} (hn : 8 ≤ n) (hk : 2 * k ≤ n + 2) :
        (0 : ℝ) < n - k - 1 := by
      rify at hn hk /- Now have hn : 8 ≤ (n : ℝ)   hk : 2 * (k : ℝ) ≤ (n : ℝ) + 2 -/
      linarith

    -- Extra hypotheses allow `push_cast` to do more work.
    example (a b c : ℕ) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : a < b + c := by
      rify [hab] at h ⊢ -- Here `zify` or `qify` would have also worked.
      linarith

## ring

`ring` solves equations in *commutative* (semi)rings, allowing for
variables in the exponent. If the goal is not appropriate for `ring`
(e.g. not an equality) `ring_nf` will be suggested. See also `ring1`,
which fails if the goal is not an equality.

- `ring!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to determine
  equality of atoms.

Examples:

    example (n : ℕ) (m : ℤ) : 2^(n+1) * m = 2 * 2^n * m := by ring
    example (a b : ℤ) (n : ℕ) : (a + b)^(n + 2) = (a^2 + b^2 + a * b + b * a) * (a + b)^n := by ring
    example (x y : ℕ) : x + id y = y + id x := by ring!

## ring1

`ring1` solves the goal when it is an equality in *commutative*

  equality of atoms.

## ring_nf

`ring_nf` simplifies expressions in the language of commutative
(semi)rings, which rewrites all ring expressions into a normal form,
allowing variables in the exponents.

`ring_nf` works as both a tactic and a conv tactic.

See also the `ring` tactic for solving a goal which is an equation in
the language of commutative (semi)rings.

- `ring_nf!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to identify
  atoms.
- `ring_nf (config := cfg)` allows for additional configuration (see
  `RingNF.Config`):
  - `red`: the reducibility setting (overridden by `!`)
  - `zetaDelta`: if true, local let variables can be unfolded
    (overridden by `!`)
  - `recursive`: if true, `ring_nf` will also recurse into atoms
- `ring_nf at l1 l2 ...` can be used to rewrite at the given locations.

Examples: This can be used non-terminally to normalize ring expressions
in the goal such as `⊢ P (x + x + x)` ~\> `⊢ P (x * 3)`, as well as
being able to prove some equations that `ring` cannot because they
involve ring reasoning inside a subterm, such as
`sin (x + y) + sin (y + x) = 2 * sin (x + y)`.

## rintro

The `rintro` tactic is a combination of the `intros` tactic with
`rcases` to allow for destructuring patterns while introducing
variables. See `rcases` for a description of supported patterns. For
example, `rintro (a | ⟨b, c⟩) ⟨d, e⟩` will introduce two variables, and
then do case splits on both of them producing two subgoals, one with
variables `a d e` and the other with `b c d e`.

`rintro`, unlike `rcases`, also supports the form `(x y : ty)` for
introducing and type-ascripting multiple variables at once, similar to
binders.

## simp

The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal
target or non-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants:

- `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the
  attribute `[simp]`.
- `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the
  lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where
  the `hᵢ`'s are expressions.-
- If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then `f` is unfolded. If `f` has
  equational lemmas associated with it (and is not a projection or a
  `reducible` definition), these are used to rewrite with `f`.
- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged
  with the attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.
- `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but
  does not use `[simp]` lemmas.
- `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the
  lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named
  `idᵢ`.
- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ...
  `hₙ : Tₙ`. If the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new
  simplified hypothesis `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in
  the local context.
- `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.
- `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses
  using the other hypotheses.

## simp_all?!

`simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent
call to `simp only` that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is
useful for reducing the size of the simp set in a local invocation to
speed up processing.

    example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
      simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"

This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

## simp_intro

The `simp_intro` tactic is a combination of `simp` and `intro`: it will
simplify the types of variables as it introduces them and uses the new
variables to simplify later arguments and the goal.

- `simp_intro x y z` introduces variables named `x y z`

- `simp_intro x y z ..` introduces variables named `x y z` and then
  keeps introducing `_` binders

- `simp_intro (config := cfg) (discharger := tac) x y .. only [h₁, h₂]`:
  `simp_intro` takes the same options as `simp` (see `simp`)

      example : x + 0 = y → x = z := by
        simp_intro h
        -- h: x = y ⊢ y = z

## simp_rw

`simp_rw` functions as a mix of `simp` and `rw`. Like `rw`, it applies
each rewrite rule in the given order, but like `simp` it repeatedly
applies these rules and also under binders like `∀ x, ...`, `∃ x, ...`
and `fun x ↦...`. Usage:

- `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n]` will rewrite the goal by applying
  the lemmas in that order. A lemma preceded by `←` is applied in the
  reverse direction.
- `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n] at h₁ ... hₙ` will rewrite the given
  hypotheses.
- `simp_rw [...] at *` rewrites in the whole context: all hypotheses and
  the goal.

Lemmas passed to `simp_rw` must be expressions that are valid arguments
to `simp`. For example, neither `simp` nor `rw` can solve the following,
but `simp_rw` can:

``` lean
example {a : ℕ}
    (h1 : ∀ a b : ℕ, a - 1 ≤ b ↔ a ≤ b + 1)
    (h2 : ∀ a b : ℕ, a ≤ b ↔ ∀ c, c < a → c < b) :
    (∀ b, a - 1 ≤ b) = ∀ b c : ℕ, c < a → c < b + 1 := by
  simp_rw [h1, h2]

## simp_wf

Unfold definitions commonly used in well founded relation definitions.

Since Lean 4.12, Lean unfolds these definitions automatically before
presenting the goal to the user, and this tactic should no longer be
necessary. Calls to `simp_wf` can be removed or replaced by plain calls
to `simp`.

## simpa

This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

- `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of `e`
  using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

  The final match between the simplified `e` and the simplified goal
  uses **reducible** transparency, so it does not unfold semireducible
  definitions. Write `simpa [rules, ⋯] using! e` to perform the match at
  the ambient (default/semireducible) transparency instead.

- `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a hypothesis
  `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using the
  `assumption` tactic.

As with `simp`, the `!` modifier after `simpa` enables auto-unfolding of
definitions in the simp set.

Tags:

## solve_by_elim

`solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption
whose head matches and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated
subgoals until no subgoals remain, performing at most `maxDepth`
(defaults to 6) recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

`solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context,
[`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl), [`trivial`](./Init/Core.html#trivial),
[`congrFun`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrFun) and
[`congrArg`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrArg).

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:

- `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
- `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local
  context, [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl),
  [`trivial`](./Init/Core.html#trivial),
  [`congrFun`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrFun), or
  [`congrArg`](./Init/Prelude.html#congrArg) unless they are explicitly
  included.
- `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
- `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been
  labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created
  using `register_label_attr`).

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking
if a solution for one goal makes other goals impossible. (Adding or
removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with
multiple goals.)

Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as
`solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`

- `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
- [`symm`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#symm): adds all
  hypotheses derived by
  [`symm`](./Mathlib/Order/Defs/Unbundled.html#symm) (defaults to
  `true`).
- `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim`
  fails (defaults to `true`).
- `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`.
  Defaults to `.default`, but it is often useful to change to
  `.reducible`, so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when
  trying to apply a lemma.

See also the doc-comment for
[`Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig`](./Lean/Meta/Tactic/Backtrack.html#Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig)

customization of `solve_by_elim`. Both `apply_assumption` and
`apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

## sorry

The `sorry` tactic is a temporary placeholder for an incomplete tactic
proof, closing the main goal using `exact sorry`.

This is intended for stubbing-out incomplete parts of a proof while
still having a syntactically correct proof skeleton. Lean will give a
warning whenever a proof uses `sorry`, so you aren't likely to miss it,
but you can double check if a theorem depends on `sorry` by looking for
[`sorryAx`](./Init/Prelude.html#sorryAx) in the output of the
`#print axioms my_thm` command, the axiom used by the implementation of
`sorry`.

## specialize

`specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` is equivalent to `replace h := h a₁ ... aₙ`. It
specializes the local hypothesis `h` by instantiating universal
quantifications and implications using the concrete terms `a₁` ... `aₙ`.
The tactic adds a new hypothesis with the same name and tries to remove
the original `h` if possible.

Example: given `h : ∀ (n : Nat), p n → q n` and `h' : p 2`, then
`specialize h 2 h'` replaces `h` with `h : q 2`.

The tactic also supports instantiating particular universal quantifiers
using named argument syntax. Example: given `h : ∀ (m n : Nat), p m n`,
then `specialize h (n := 2)` replaces `h` with `h : ∀ (m : Nat), p m 2`.

## split

The `split` tactic is useful for breaking nested if-then-else and
`match` expressions into separate cases. For a `match` expression with
`n` cases, the `split` tactic generates at most `n` subgoals.

For example, given `n : `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat), and a target
`if n = 0 then Q else R`, `split` will generate one goal with hypothesis
`n = 0` and target `Q`, and a second goal with hypothesis `¬n = 0` and
target `R`. Note that the introduced hypothesis is unnamed, and is
commonly renamed using the `case` or `next` tactics.

- `split` will split the goal (target).
- `split at h` will split the hypothesis `h`.

## split_ifs

`split_ifs` splits the main goal in two goals for every if-then-else
expression it contains, by applying excluded middle to the condition. If
the goal has the form `g (if p then x else y)`, `split_ifs` will result
in two goals `h✝ : p ⊢ g x` and `h✝ : ¬p ⊢ g y`. If there are multiple
if-then-else expressions, then `split_ifs` will split them all, starting
with a top-most one whose condition does not contain another
if-then-else expression.

- `split_ifs with h₁ h₂ h₃` names the introduced hypotheses. Note that
  names are not reused across splits: on a goal of the form
  `⊢ (if p then 1 else 2) + (if q then 3 else 4)`, use
  `split_ifs with hp hq hq` to name all the hypotheses.
- `split_ifs at l` splits the if-then-else expressions at location(s)
  `l`.

## squeeze_scope

The `squeeze_scope` tactic allows aggregating multiple calls to `simp`
coming from the same syntax but in different branches of execution, such
as in `cases x <;> simp`. The reported `simp` call covers all simp
lemmas used by this syntax.

    @[simp] def bar (z : Nat) := 1 + z
    @[simp] def baz (z : Nat) := 1 + z

    @[simp] def foo : Nat → Nat → Nat
      | 0, z => bar z
      | _+1, z => baz z

    example : foo x y = 1 + y := by
      cases x <;> simp? -- two printouts:
      -- "Try this: simp only [foo, bar]"
      -- "Try this: simp only [foo, baz]"

    example : foo x y = 1 + y := by
      squeeze_scope
        cases x <;> simp -- only one printout: "Try this: simp only [foo, baz, bar]"

## subsingleton

`subsingleton` proves the main goal of the form `∀ a ... b, x = y` or
`∀ a ... b, x ≍ y` using the fact that the type(s) of `x` and `y` are
*subsingletons* (a type with exactly zero or one elements). If
`subsingleton` cannot close the goal, it fails.

Techniques the `subsingleton` tactic can apply:

- proof irrelevance
- heterogeneous proof irrelevance (via
  [`proof_irrel_heq`](./Init/PropLemmas.html#proof_irrel_heq))
- using [`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton) (via
  [`Subsingleton.elim`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton.elim))
- proving instances of the type [`BEq`](./Init/Prelude.html#BEq)` α` are
  equal if they are both lawful (via
  [`lawful_beq_subsingleton`](./Mathlib/Logic/Basic.html#lawful_beq_subsingleton))

<!-- -->

- `subsingleton [inst1, inst2, ...]` can be used to add additional
  [`Subsingleton`](./Init/Core.html#Subsingleton) instances to the local
  context. This can be more flexible than
  `have := inst1; have := inst2; ...; subsingleton` since the tactic
  does not require that all placeholders be solved for.

## subst

`subst x...` substitutes each hypothesis `x` with a definition found in
the local context, then eliminates the hypothesis.

- If `x` is a local definition, then its definition is used.
- Otherwise, if there is a hypothesis of the form `x = e` or `e = x`,
  then `e` is used for the definition of `x`.

If `h : a = b`, then `subst h` may be used if either `a` or `b` unfolds
to a local hypothesis. This is similar to the `cases h` tactic.

## tauto

`tauto` proves tautologies in classical propositional logic. It breaks

splits a goal of the form `_ ∧ _`, `_ ↔ _` or `∃ _, _` until it can be
discharged using [`rfl`](./Init/Prelude.html#rfl), `contradiction` or
`solve_by_elim`. This is a finishing tactic: it either closes the goal
or raises an error.

This tactic makes no attempt to avoid classical reasoning. The `itauto`

`∩`, `\`, and `ᶜ` from finitely many variables of type
[`Set`](./Mathlib/Data/Set/Defs.html#Set)` α`. It also unfolds
expressions of the form
[`Disjoint`](./Mathlib/Order/Disjoint.html#Disjoint)` A B` and
[`symmDiff`](./Mathlib/Order/SymmDiff.html#symmDiff)` A B`. In other
words, this tactic proves propositional tautologies, expressed in the
language of sets. This is a finishing tactic: it either closes the goal
or raises an error.

Examples:

``` lean
example {α} (A B C D : Set α) (h1 : A ⊆ B) (h2 : C ⊆ D) : C \ B ⊆ D \ A := by
  tauto_set

example {α} (A B C : Set α) (h1 : A ⊆ B ∪ C) : (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) = A := by
  tauto_set

## tfae_finish

`tfae_finish` closes goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]` once a
sufficient collection of hypotheses of the form `Pᵢ → Pⱼ` or `Pᵢ ↔ Pⱼ`
have been introduced to the local context.

`tfae_have` can be used to conveniently introduce these hypotheses; see
`tfae_have`.

Example:

``` lean4
example : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry /- proof of P → Q -/
  tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry /- proof of Q → P -/
  tfae_have 2 ↔ 3 := sorry /- proof of Q ↔ R -/
  tfae_finish
```

## tfae_have

`tfae_have i → j := t`, where the goal is `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`
introduces a hypothesis `tfae_i_to_j : Pᵢ → Pⱼ` and proof `t` to the
local context. Note that `i` and `j` are natural number literals
(beginning at 1) used as indices to specify the propositions
`P₁, P₂, ...` that appear in the goal.

Once sufficient hypotheses have been introduced by `tfae_have`,
`tfae_finish` can be used to close the goal.

All features of `have` are supported by `tfae_have`, including naming,
matching, destructuring, and goal creation.

- `tfae_have i ← j := t` adds a hypothesis in the reverse direction, of
  type `Pⱼ → Pᵢ`.
- `tfae_have i ↔ j := t` adds a hypothesis in the both directions, of
  type `Pᵢ ↔ Pⱼ`.
- `tfae_have hij : i → j := t` names the introduced hypothesis `hij`
  instead of `tfae_i_to_j`.
- `tfae_have i j | p₁ => t₁ | ...` matches on the assumption `p : Pᵢ`.
- `tfae_have ⟨hij, hji⟩ : i ↔ j := t` destructures the bi-implication
  into `hij : Pᵢ → Pⱼ` and `hji : Pⱼ → Pⱼ`.
- `tfae_have i → j := t ?a` creates a new goal for `?a`.

Examples:

``` lean4
example (h : P → R) : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 3 := h
  -- The resulting context now includes `tfae_1_to_3 : P → R`.
  sorry
```

``` lean4
-- An example of `tfae_have` and `tfae_finish`:

  tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry /- proof of Q → P -/
  tfae_have 2 ↔ 3 := sorry /- proof of Q ↔ R -/
  tfae_finish

  -- assert `hpq : P → Q`:
  tfae_have hpq : 1 → 2 := sorry

  -- match on `p : P` and prove `Q` via `f p`:
  tfae_have 1 → 2
  | p => f p

  -- assert `pq : P → Q`, `qp : Q → P`:
  tfae_have ⟨pq, qp⟩ : 1 ↔ 2 := sorry

  -- assert `h : P → Q`; `?a` is a new goal:
  tfae_have h : 1 → 2 := f ?a

## unfold

- `unfold `[`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id) unfolds all occurrences of
  definition [`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id) in the target.
- `unfold id1 id2 ...` is equivalent to `unfold id1; unfold id2; ...`.
- `unfold `[`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id)` at h` unfolds at the
  hypothesis `h`.

Definitions can be either global or local definitions.

For non-recursive global definitions, this tactic is identical to
`delta`. For recursive global definitions, it uses the "unfolding lemma"
`id.eq_def`, which is generated for each recursive definition, to unfold
according to the recursive definition given by the user. Only one level
of unfolding is performed, in contrast to `simp only [id]`, which
unfolds definition [`id`](./Init/Prelude.html#id) recursively.

## unhygienic

`unhygienic tacs` runs `tacs` with name hygiene disabled. This means
that tactics that would normally create inaccessible names will instead
make regular variables. **Warning**: Tactics may change their variable
naming strategies at any time, so code that depends on autogenerated
names is brittle. Users should try not to use `unhygienic` if possible.

    example : ∀ x : Nat, x = x := by unhygienic
      intro            -- x would normally be intro'd as inaccessible
      exact Eq.refl x  -- refer to x

## unreachable!

This tactic causes a panic when run (at compile time). (This is distinct
from `exact unreachable!`, which inserts code which will panic at run
time.)

It is intended for tests to assert that a tactic will never be executed,
which is otherwise an unusual thing to do (and the `unreachableTactic`
linter will give a warning if you do).

The `unreachableTactic` linter has a special exception for uses of
`unreachable!`.

    example : True := by trivial <;> unreachable!

## use

`use e₁, e₂, ⋯` instantiates all existential quantifiers in the main
goal by using `e₁`, `e₂`, ... as witnesses, creates goals for all the
remaining witnesses, and tries to discharge these goals automatically.

`use` is similar to `exists` or `existsi`, but unlike `exists` it is
equivalent to applying the tactic `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with
any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and then trying to
close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable
discharger (rather than just
`try `[`trivial`](./Init/Core.html#trivial)).

- `use! e₁, e₂, ⋯` applies constructors everywhere rather than just for
  goals that correspond to the last argument of a constructor. This
  gives the effect that nested constructors are being flattened out,
  with the supplied values being used along the leaves and nodes of the
  tree of constructors.
- `use (discharger := tac) e₁, e₂, ...` calls `tac` as a discharger, on
  all remaining `Prop`-valued goals. If this option is omitted, `use`
  calls `try with_reducible use_discharger` as default discharger. To
  turn off the discharger and keep all goals, use
  `(discharger := skip)`. To allow "heavy refls", use
  `(discharger := try use_discharger)`. If `tac` fails on the new goal,
  `use (discharger := tac)` fails (hint: you might want to use
  `(discharger := try tac)` instead).

Examples:

``` lean
example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

example : Nonempty Nat := by use 5

example : Nonempty (PNat ≃ Nat) := by
  use PNat.natPred, Nat.succPNat
  · exact PNat.succPNat_natPred
  · intro; rfl

-- With `use!` one can feed in each `42` one at a time:
example : ∃ n : {n : Nat // n % 2 = 0}, n.val > 10 := by use! 20; simp

example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! (42, 42)
/-
The second line makes use of the fact that `use!` tries refining with the argument before
applying a constructor. Also note that `use`/`use!` by default uses a tactic
called `use_discharger` to discharge goals, so `use! 42` will close the goal in this example since
`use_discharger` applies `rfl`, which as a consequence solves for the other `Nat` metavariable.

## wlog

`wlog h : P` adds an assumption `h : P` to the main goal, and adds a
side goal that requires showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced
to the case where `P` holds (typically by symmetry). The side goal will
be at the top of the stack. In this side goal, there will be two
additional assumptions:

- `h : ¬ P`: the assumption that `P` does not hold
- `this`: which is the statement that in the old context `P` suffices to
  prove the goal. By default, the entire context is reverted to produce
  `this`.

<!-- -->

- `wlog h : P with H` gives the name `H` to the statement that `P`
  proves the goal.
- `wlog h : P generalizing x y ...` reverts certain parts of the context
  before creating the new goal. In this way, the wlog-claim `this` can
  be applied to `x` and `y` in different orders (exploiting symmetry,
  which is the typical use case).
- `wlog! h : P` also calls `push `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not) at
  the generated hypothesis `h`. `wlog! h : P ∧ Q` will transform
  `¬ (P ∧ Q)` to `P → ¬ Q`
- `wlog! +distrib h : P` also calls
  `push +distrib `[`Not`](./Init/Prelude.html#Not) at the generated
  hypothesis `h`. `wlog! +distrib h : P ∧ Q` will transform `¬ (P ∧ Q)`
  to `¬P ∨ ¬Q`.

## zify

`zify` rewrites the main goal by shifting propositions from `ℕ` to `ℤ`.
This is often useful since `ℤ` has well-behaved subtraction.

`zify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` attribute to insert casts into
propositions, and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℤ`-valued
expressions.

`zify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic.
`lift (z : Int) to `[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) will change the
type of an integer `z` (in the supertype) to
[`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) (the subtype), given a proof that
`z ≥ 0`; propositions concerning `z` will still be over
[`Int`](./Init/Data/Int/Basic.html#Int). `zify` changes propositions
about [`Nat`](./Init/Prelude.html#Nat) (the subtype) to propositions
about [`Int`](./Init/Data/Int/Basic.html#Int) (the supertype), without
changing the type of any variable.

- `zify at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
- `zify [h₁, ..., hₙ]` uses the expressions `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` as extra
  lemmas for simplification. This is especially useful in the presence
  of nat subtraction or of division: passing arguments of type `· ≤ ·`
  will allow `push_cast` to do more work.

Examples:

    example (a b c x y z : Nat) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
      zify
      zify at h
      /-
      h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
      ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b
      -/
      sorry

    example (a b c : Nat) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : False := by
      -- Nonnegativity hypothesis allows pushing `· - ·`.
