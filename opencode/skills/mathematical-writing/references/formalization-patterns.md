# Formalization Patterns

Templates for translating mathematical proofs into Lean 4, with SageMath verification
pairs.

## Core Translation Principles

1. **Explicit Types:** Always specify the type of every object.
   - Instead of: "Let a be an element..."
   - Write: "Let a ∈ R..." or "Let a : R..."

2. **Quantify Variables:** Make all quantifiers explicit.
   - Instead of: "x + y = y + x"
   - Write: "∀x, y ∈ G: x + y = y + x"

3. **State Assumptions:** Include all necessary hypotheses.
   - Instead of: "Since G is abelian..."
   - Write: "Let G be an abelian group.
     Then..."

4. **Use Standard Names:** Match Lean's naming conventions.
   - monoid → Monoid
   - is_subgroup → IsSubgroup
   - ring_hom → RingHom

5. **Structure Proofs:** Follow Lean's proof term structure.
   - Use "have" for intermediate results
   - Use "suffices" to break down goals
   - Use "by_cases" for case analysis

## Pattern: Induction

### Mathematical Style

*Theorem.* For all n ∈ NN, 2ⁿ > n.

*Proof.* By induction on n.
- [Base] For n = 0: 2⁰ = 1 > 0.
- [Inductive] Assume 2ᵏ > k for some k ≥ 0. Then 2ᵏ⁺¹ = 2 · 2ᵏ > 2k ≥ k + 1 since k ≥ 0.

### Lean 4

```lean
theorem two_pow_gt_n (n : ℕ) : 2^n > n :=
  by
  induction' n with k ih
  · -- Base case
    norm_num
  · -- Inductive step
    rw [Nat.pow_succ]
    have : 2 * k ≥ k + 1 := by omega
    exact lt_of_lt_of_le (mul_lt_mul_left' ih 2 (by norm_num)) this
```

### SageMath Verification

```python
def verify_two_pow_gt_n(max_n=20):
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        assert 2**n > n, f"Failed at n={n}"
    return "All tests passed"

verify_two_pow_gt_n()
```

* * *

## Pattern: Contradiction

### Mathematical Style

*Theorem.* √2 is irrational.

*Proof.* Assume ∃m, n ∈ NN with n ≠ 0 and m.coprime n such that m² = 2n². Then ...
[contradiction].

### Lean 4

```lean
theorem sqrt_two_irrational : ¬ ∃ (m n : ℕ), n ≠ 0 ∧ m.coprime n ∧ m^2 = 2 * n^2 :=
by
  rintro ⟨m, n, hn, h_cop, h⟩
  -- Proof by contradiction...
```

### SageMath Verification

```python
def is_perfect_square(n):
    return int(n**0.5)**2 == n

# Check that √2 is not rational (for small denominators)
for d in range(1, 1000):
    assert not is_perfect_square(2 * d * d), f"√2 is rational with denominator {d}"
```

* * *

## Pattern: Existence

### Mathematical Style

*Lemma.* In a field, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

*Proof.* Let a ≠ 0. Then a⁻¹ exists and a · a⁻¹ = 1.

### Lean 4

```lean
-- Existence of inverse in a field
example {α : Type} [Field α] (a : α) (ha : a ≠ 0) : ∃ b, a * b = 1 :=
  ⟨a⁻¹, mul_inv_cancel ha⟩
```

### SageMath Verification

```python
# Finding multiplicative inverse in GF(p)
p = 7  # prime field
F = GF(p)

for a in F:
    if a != 0:
        b = a^-1  # inverse exists for non-zero elements
        assert a * b == 1, f"Inverse failed for {a}"
```

* * *

## Pattern: Definitions

### Mathematical Style

Let G be a group. A subset H ⊆ G is a *subgroup* if:
1. e ∈ H (contains identity)
2. ∀a, b ∈ H: ab ∈ H (closed under multiplication)
3. ∀a ∈ H: a⁻¹ ∈ H (closed under inverses)

### Corresponding Lean 4

```lean
class Subgroup (G : Type) [Group G] (H : Set G) : Prop where
  one_mem : (1 : G) ∈ H
  mul_mem {a b} : a ∈ H → b ∈ H → a * b ∈ H
  inv_mem {a} : a ∈ H → a⁻¹ ∈ H
```

* * *

## Pattern: Theorems and Proofs

### Mathematical Style

*Theorem.* Every finite integral domain is a field.

*Proof.* Let R be a finite integral domain and let 0 ≠ a ∈ R.
1. Define φ_a: R → R by x ↦ ax.
2. φ_a is injective since R is a domain.
3. Since R is finite, φ_a is also surjective.
4. Thus, ∃b ∈ R such that ab = 1.
5. Therefore, a has an inverse in R.

### Corresponding Lean 4

```lean
theorem finite_domain_is_field (R : Type) [Ring R] [IsDomain R] [Fintype R] : Field R :=
  { exists_pair_ne := ⟨0, 1, zero_ne_one⟩
    mul_inv_cancel := fun a ha => by
      have : Function.Bijective (fun x => a * x) :=
        (injective_mul_left_iff_ne_zero (id ha : a ≠ 0)).bijective_of_finite_surjective
          (fun x => ⟨a * x, rfl⟩)
      let ⟨b, hb⟩ := this.surjective 1
      ⟨b, hb.symm⟩
    ..‹IsDomain R›, (inferInstance : CommRing R) }
```

* * *

## Pattern: Group Theory (Cosets and Normality)

### Mathematical Style

*Lemma.* Let G be a group and H ≤ G. If [G:H] = 2, then H ⊲ G.

*Proof.*
1. Let g ∈ G. We show gH = Hg.
2. **Case 1:** g ∈ H. Then gH = H = Hg.
3. **Case 2:** g ∉ H. Then G = H ∪ gH = H ∪ Hg.
4. Since [G:H] = 2, these are disjoint unions.
5. Thus gH = G \ H = Hg.

### Corresponding Lean 4

```lean
theorem index_two_normal (G : Type*) [Group G] (H : Subgroup G)
    (hH : Fintype.card (G ⧸ H) = 2) : H.Normal :=
  ⟨fun g => by
    by_cases h : g ∈ H
    · simp [h, Subgroup.mem_carrier, Subgroup.mul_mem_cancel_right H h]
    · have := (Fintype.bijective_iff_injective_and_card
          (fun x => g • x) (by simp)).mp (mul_action.bijective g)
      rw [←Fintype.card_congr (Equiv.Set.compl _)] at hH
      have : {x // x ∈ H} ≃ {x // x ∉ H} := by
        refine Equiv.ofBijective _ ?_
        exact Set.BijOn.bijective (by {
          -- Proof that multiplication by g is a bijection between H and its complement
          -- Implementation details omitted for brevity
          })
      -- Rest of the proof...
  ⟩
```

* * *

## Pattern: Sum Formulas (Verification)

### Mathematical Style

*Theorem.* For all n ∈ NN, the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n².

### Lean 4 Proof

```lean
theorem sum_odds (n : ℕ) : (∑ k in Finset.range n, (2 * k + 1)) = n ^ 2 :=
  by
  -- Base case
  cases n with
  | zero => simp
  | succ n ih =>
    -- Inductive step
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ, ih, Nat.succ_eq_add_one]
    ring
```

### SageMath Verification

```python
# Verify sum of first n odd numbers equals n²
def verify_sum_odds(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        odd_sum = sum(2*k + 1 for k in range(n))
        assert odd_sum == n**2, f"Failed at n={n}"
    return "All tests passed"

verify_sum_odds()
```
