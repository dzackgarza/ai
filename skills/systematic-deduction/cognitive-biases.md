# Cognitive Biases Reference

**Source:** [Wikipedia: List of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

**Classification:** Based on Dimara et al. (2020) task-based classification with 6 tasks (estimation, decision, hypothesis assessment, causal attribution, recall, opinion reporting) and 5 sub-categories ("flavors"):

1. **Association:** a connection between different pieces of information
2. **Baseline:** comparing something to a perceived standard or starting point
3. **Inertia:** the reluctance to change something that is already in place
4. **Outcome:** how well something aligns with an expected or hoped-for result
5. **Self-perspective:** influenced by one's own personal point of view

## Estimation

In estimation or judgement tasks, people are asked to assess the value of a quantity.

### Association

- **Aesthetic–usability effect:** A tendency for people to perceive attractive things as more usable.
- **Attribute substitution:** Occurs when a judgment has to be made (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead a more easily calculated heuristic attribute is substituted. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system.
- **The availability heuristic (also known as the availability bias):** The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater "availability" in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be. There is a greater likelihood of recalling recent, nearby, or otherwise immediately available examples, and the imputation of importance to those examples over others.
- **Conjunction fallacy:** The tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than a more general version of those same conditions.
- **Hot-cold empathy gap:** The tendency to underestimate the influence of visceral drives on one's attitudes, preferences, and behaviors.
- **Tachypsychia:** When time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts.
- **Time-saving bias:** A tendency to underestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively low speed, and to overestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively high speed.
- **Travis syndrome:** Overestimating the significance of the present. It is related to chronological snobbery with possibly an appeal to novelty logical fallacy being part of the bias.

### Baseline

- **The anchoring bias (or focalism):** The tendency to rely too heavily—to "anchor"—on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).
- **Base rate fallacy (or base rate neglect):** The tendency to ignore general information and focus on information only pertaining to the specific case, even when the general information is more important.
- **Dunning–Kruger effect:** The tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability and the tendency for experts to underestimate their own ability.
- **Gambler's fallacy:** The tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the law of large numbers. For example, "I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads."
- **Hard–easy effect:** The tendency to overestimate one's ability to accomplish hard tasks, and underestimate one's ability to accomplish easy tasks.
- **Hot-hand fallacy (also known as "hot hand phenomenon" or "hot hand"):** The belief that a person who has experienced success with a random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.
- **Insensitivity to sample size:** The tendency to under-expect variation in small samples.
- **Interoceptive bias (or Hungry judge effect):** The tendency for sensory input about the body itself to affect one's judgement about external, unrelated circumstances. (As for example, in parole judges who are more lenient when fed and rested.)
- **Conservatism (or Regressive bias):** Tendency to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies as lower than they actually were and low ones as higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough.
- **Subadditivity effect:** The tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components.
- **Systematic bias:** Judgement that arises when targets of differentiating judgement become subject to effects of regression that are not equivalent.
- **Unit bias:** The standard suggested amount of consumption (e.g., food serving size) is perceived to be appropriate, and a person would consume it all even if it is too much for this particular person.
- **Weber–Fechner law:** Difficulty in perceiving and comparing small differences in large quantities.

### Inertia

- **Conservatism bias:** The tendency to insufficiently revise one's belief when presented with new evidence.

### Outcome

- **Exaggerated expectation:** The tendency to expect or predict more extreme outcomes than those outcomes that actually happen.
- **Hedonic recall bias:** The tendency for people who are satisfied with their wage to overestimate how much they earn, and conversely, for people who are unsatisfied with their wage to underestimate it.
- **Illusion of validity:** The tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one's judgments, especially when available information is consistent or inter-correlated.
- **Impact bias:** The tendency to overestimate the length or the intensity of the impact of future feeling states.
- **Outcome bias:** The tendency to judge a decision by its eventual outcome instead of the quality of the decision at the time it was made.
- **Planning fallacy:** The tendency for people to underestimate the time it will take them to complete a given task.
- **Restraint bias:** The tendency to overestimate one's ability to show restraint in the face of temptation.
- **Sexual overperception bias:** The tendency to overestimate sexual interest of another person in oneself, and sexual underperception bias, the tendency to underestimate it.

### Self-perspective

- **Curse of knowledge:** When better-informed people find it extremely difficult to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed people.
- **Extrinsic incentives bias:** An exception to the fundamental attribution error, where people view others as having (situational) extrinsic motivations, while viewing themselves as having (dispositional) intrinsic motivations.
- **False consensus effect:** The tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.
- **Illusion of transparency:** The tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others, and to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states.
- **Naïve cynicism:** Expecting more egocentric bias in others than in oneself.
- **Optimism bias:** The tendency to be over-optimistic, underestimating greatly the probability of undesirable outcomes and overestimating favorable and pleasing outcomes (see also wishful thinking, valence effect, positive outcome bias, and compare pessimism bias).
- **Outgroup homogeneity bias:** Where individuals see members of other groups as being relatively less varied than members of their own group.
- **Pessimism bias:** The tendency to overestimate the likelihood that bad things will happen (compare optimism bias).
- **Spotlight effect:** The tendency to overestimate the amount that other people notice one's appearance or behavior.
