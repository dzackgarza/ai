# SDL.md - SDL-MCP Agent Workflow

Use this file as the repository fallback for the `sdl-mcp-agent-workflow` skill. If that skill is loaded by the client or by a session-start hook, treat the skill as authoritative and use this file as a compact local reference.

SDL-MCP is the normal repository interface. Native filesystem and shell tools are fallback-only when SDL-MCP is unavailable, or when accessing agent memory and other internal client data outside the indexed repository.

---

## 1. Start Every Task

1. Confirm server and repository state with `repo.status`.
2. Start task context with `sdl.context`, not raw file reads.
3. Use `options.contextMode: "precise"` for named symbols, exact paths, narrow bugs, focused reviews, and implementation follow-up.
4. Use `options.contextMode: "broad"` for subsystem mapping, behavior tracing, unfamiliar areas, or broad investigation.
5. Keep `responseMode: "auto"` for potentially large responses. If a response handle is returned, use `response.get` only for the needed excerpt.
6. Use focused `sdl.manual` only when composing a non-obvious request. Use `sdl.action.search` when the correct SDL action is unclear.

Do not run `index.refresh` by habit. Refresh only when `repo.status` shows stale or missing indexed state and the task depends on current code.

---

## 2. Retrieval Ladder

Start with `sdl.context`. If the answer still needs more evidence, batch follow-up operations through `sdl.workflow` in this order:

1. `symbolSearch`
2. `symbolGetCard`
3. `codeSkeleton`
4. `codeHotPath`
5. `codeNeedWindow`

Use `codeNeedWindow` only as a last resort. Include a concrete `reason`, bounded `expectedLines`, and precise `identifiersToFind`. If SDL-MCP returns `nextBestAction`, `fallbackTools`, `fallbackRationale`, or denial guidance, follow that guidance instead of retrying broader native reads or larger raw windows.

When workflow steps need fields from earlier `$N` references, force JSON-compatible output on the earlier step. Keep limits tight and pass ETags back when available.

}
```

## 3. File And Edit Rules

Use SDL file and edit tools instead of native read/write paths.

- Read non-indexed files with `file.read` or `sdl.file` `op: "read"`. Prefer `search`, `jsonPath`, or bounded ranges over full reads.
- Write non-indexed files with `file.write` or `sdl.file` `op: "write"` using exactly one targeted write mode.
- Edit indexed source with `symbol.edit` or `sdl.file` `symbolEditPreview` followed by `symbolEditApply` when the edit is anchored to one symbol.
- Use `symbolEditApplyNow` only with a fresh `astFingerprint` and range from a current symbol card.
- Use `search.edit` or `sdl.file` `op: "searchEditPreview"` for cross-file or repeated indexed-source edits. Prefer `targeting: "identifier"` for exact AST identifier replacements in supported structural languages that must avoid comments and strings, `targeting: "structural"` for tree-sitter capture edits such as calls, imports, properties, or plugin-defined grammar captures, and `operations[]` for heterogeneous batches.
- Apply the returned plan handle only after reviewing snippets, file counts, and any `astMatches` capture summaries.
- Use `sdl.workflow` plus `runtimeExecute` for a targeted script only when SDL edit tools cannot express the indexed-source edit; pass multiline payloads through `stdin`.
- Track backup paths returned by edit/write tools and remove created `.bak` files after verification through SDL-governed runtime cleanup. Do not run broad native cleanup commands.

### Non-Indexed Reads

```json
{
  "repoId": "<repoId>",
  "steps": [
    {
      "fn": "fileRead",
      "args": { "filePath": "package.json", "jsonPath": "scripts" }
    },
    {
      "fn": "fileRead",
      "args": {
        "filePath": "docs/guide.md",
        "search": "authentication",
        "searchContext": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "fn": "fileRead",
      "args": { "filePath": "config/app.yaml", "offset": 10, "limit": 40 }
    }
  ],
  "budget": { "maxTokens": 4000 },
  "onError": "stop"
}
```

### Non-Indexed Writes

```json
{
  "repoId": "<repoId>",
  "steps": [
    {
      "fn": "fileWrite",
      "args": {
        "filePath": "config/app.json",
        "jsonPath": "server.port",
        "jsonValue": 8080,
        "createBackup": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "budget": { "maxTokens": 2000 },
  "onError": "stop"
}
```

### Indexed Source Edits

```json
{
  "repoId": "<repoId>",
  "steps": [
    {
      "fn": "symbolEditPreview",
      "args": {
        "symbolId": "src/config/parse.ts::parseConfig",
        "edit": {
          "mode": "replacePattern",
          "pattern": "oldTimeout",
          "replacement": "newTimeout"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "fn": "symbolEditApply",
      "args": { "planHandle": "$0.planHandle" }
    }
  ],
  "budget": { "maxTokens": 4000 },
  "onError": "stop"
}
```

## 4. Runtime Output Control

Run repo-local commands through `runtimeExecute` inside `sdl.workflow`.

Default to `outputMode: "minimal"`, `persistOutput: true`, and an explicit `timeoutMs`. Use `stdin` for multiline scripts/input instead of PowerShell here-strings, quote-heavy `node -e`, or base64 decode/eval workarounds. Query stored logs only when needed with `runtimeQueryOutput` and focused `queryTerms`. Use `outputMode: "intent"` when the command intent is already tied to known terms such as `FAIL`, `Error`, or a test name.

Do not use runtime execution to print indexed source. Use the retrieval ladder instead.

### Execute First

```json
{
  "repoId": "<repoId>",
  "steps": [
    {
      "fn": "runtimeExecute",
      "args": {
        "runtime": "node",
        "args": ["--test", "tests/config.test.ts"],
        "outputMode": "minimal",
        "persistOutput": true,
        "timeoutMs": 30000
      }
    }
  ],
  "budget": { "maxTokens": 1000 },
  "onError": "stop"
}
```

### Query Only Needed Output

```json
{
  "repoId": "<repoId>",
  "steps": [
    {
      "fn": "runtimeQueryOutput",
      "args": {
        "artifactHandle": "runtime-<repoId>-...",
        "queryTerms": ["FAIL", "Error", "AssertionError", "config.test"],
        "maxExcerpts": 8,
        "contextLines": 3,
        "stream": "both"
      }
    }
  ],
  "budget": { "maxTokens": 3000 },
  "onError": "stop"
}
```

For shell runtime, provide `code` when a shell wrapper is the right abstraction.

## 5. Memory And Indexing

Assume SDL memory is disabled unless `repo.status`, config, or tool discovery shows `memory.enabled: true`. If disabled, do not repeatedly call memory tools.

When memory is enabled:

- Use `memory.query` for task-text lookup.
- Use `memory.surface` after relevant symbol IDs are known.
- At completion, store durable decisions, bugfixes, patterns, conventions, architecture notes, performance findings, or security notes with `memory.store`.
- Link `symbolIds` and `fileRelPaths` when useful.

For indexing:

- Do not refresh by habit.
- Run `index.refresh` only when `repo.status` shows stale or missing indexed state and the task depends on current code.
- Prefer incremental refresh.
- If refresh runs asynchronously, poll `repo.status` and wait for completion before continuing graph-backed retrieval.
- Avoid full refresh unless the repo is newly registered, unindexed, or explicitly required.

---

## 6. Delegated Exploration

When code exploration needs a sub-agent, team agent, or delegated codebase investigation and the client supports agents, use SDL Explorer instead of a generic Explore agent.

Keep the assignment read-only unless the user explicitly requests implementation. Tell SDL Explorer to follow the SDL-MCP Agent Workflow and return symbol IDs, files, card summaries, slice handles, runtime artifact handles, and unresolved questions rather than raw source dumps.

---

## 7. Hook Enforcement

Generated enforcement is conditional on the SDL-MCP PID file.

- When the PID file is absent, native tools are allowed.
- When the PID file is present, repo-targeting native shell, file read/write/edit, apply-patch, and non-SDL MCP file/search tools are denied.
- Repo `.codex/**`, repo `.claude/**`, and non-repo agent skills, memories, and session internals remain allowed.

If a hook denies a native tool:

1. Read the hook message; it lists the SDL action to use.
2. Follow SDL response guidance such as `nextBestAction`, `fallbackTools`, and `fallbackRationale`.
3. Do not retry the blocked native tool.
4. If still stuck, call `sdl.action.search({ query: "<intent>" })`.

---

## 8. Completion Checklist

Before the final response:

1. Verify the requested work through SDL-MCP runtime or focused SDL checks when applicable.
2. Remove `.bak` files created during the task, or clearly report any kept intentionally.
3. Call `usageStats` with `scope: "session"` and `persist: true` when SDL-MCP was used.
4. Report the session token savings summary to the user.

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

- Starting with native `Read`, `Grep`, shell search, or repo-wide listing instead of `sdl.context`.
- Calling `codeNeedWindow` before `symbolGetCard`, `codeSkeleton`, and `codeHotPath`.
- Using `runtimeExecute` to print indexed source.
- Running `index.refresh` every session or defaulting to full refresh.
- Reading whole non-indexed files when `search`, `jsonPath`, or bounded ranges would answer.
- Writing indexed source through native edits instead of `symbol.edit`, symbol edit preview/apply, or AST-aware `searchEditPreview`.
- Keeping `.bak` files without reporting them.
- Omitting `usageStats` after an SDL-MCP-backed task.
